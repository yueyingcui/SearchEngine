Nike Lunareclipse+ 2
I own a dozen pairs of Nikes ranging from Free Runs to Air Max and these are by far the most comfortable pair of Nikes I have ever worn. The Lunarlon sole and dynamic fit come together to create the perfect tight fit around the midsole. The shoe does run a half size larger compared to other Nikes so remember to size down by a half size. 
I got this shoe because it has stability and great cushioning. Being able to use Nike+ was a perk, though my Garmin watch is far more accurate. I got the black and University Red color, no problems with the sole peeling, I have run 4 times and have about 20 miles on them, during a recent 10k the cushioning seemed to go stiff around mile 5. The only downside, is that Nike sizing is unpredictable. I got these in 12's but they felt about a half size too big, not even feet swell during running made a difference.
I love the style and structure of this shoe, but both the 11 and 11.5 I tried feel very tight in the arch area. I downsized from the 11.5 because my toe was so far from the end of the shoe, yet the tight feeling near the arch and all around the middle of my foot feels pinched. The sole feels good, great support and plenty of room in the toe box, but I feel like the shoe needs to be deeper.
Wonderful Shoe! I have tried many Running Shoes in the past. Asics: Gel-Nimbus12, Gel-Kayano16 & Onitsuka Tiger: Ultimate81 and California78. Nike: Free Run+2, Pegasus+27 & Lunar Glide+2. None of these shoes fit my form of running or my shaped foot. When running, I step only on the ball of my foot. I do not strike the ground with my heel at any point in each step; as a result, I have a "Partial" Supinate form. Also, my feet are a size "D" in width. This lightweight shoe, comforts, contours, and supports my foot perfectly. Needless to say, the Red/Black color-way will be sure to dilate pupils! Great Job Nike!
