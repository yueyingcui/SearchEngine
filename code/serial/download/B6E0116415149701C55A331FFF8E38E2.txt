Sanuk Overboard Sunbrella
Super comfortable and true to size.  I wear a 14 and have to buy everything online.  These were perfect.
Very comfy, but runs a bit small. My toe touches the end, which is normally not a good thing, but these are so soft it hasn't been a problem. Getting a full size larger would have been too sloppy. Wish they had half sizes. Nice shoes, and well made.
