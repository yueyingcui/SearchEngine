Tsukihoshi Kids Phoenix (Toddler)
My 3 year old son picked these out at a store...said they looked fast! So they definitely have style going for them. I felt they were fairly true to size lengthwise. He was measuring between 8.5 and 9, so went with the 9. Okay for length, but seemed very narrow. Maybe it was the overall stiffness of the shoe but, we all (son, hubby and myself) had a tough time getting them on. We really have to jam his foot in. He is growing out of them now and we will not be ordering this style again. Love Tsukihoshi brand though and am looking at the Euro as our next pair.
We love these shoes!  Our son loves to run in them and they are flexible for growing feet.  They are also wide and run a little big.  Good to order a 1/2 size smaller.  Our son has wide feet and these are a perfect and comfortable fit!  Plus they are machine washable, another plus!
