Superga Kids 205 COTJ (Toddler/Youth)
These are durable, true to size and totally awesome. My daughter is starting preschool and these are going to be great for the playground but they will keep her stylish as well.
I agree with the previous review, Superga toddler does run a full size larger. I would have to return it and get a size smaller. 

Absolutely adorable, but about a size too big... shoe is wide so my daughterâ€™s foot kind of floats around in there still... I think socks in the meantime while help as she grows into them... worth hanging on to...
