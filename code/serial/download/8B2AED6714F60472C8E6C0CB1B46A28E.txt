inov-8 Road-X™ 233
This is my 3rd pair. The shoe is great for my forefoot strike. A half size down leaves me feeling sure footed and my transition is smooth. These shoes last about 6 months, about 20 miles/week and 200lbs.
I'm a bigger guy (over 200lbs), have wide flatter feet than most and occasionally pronate and crossfit a lot. Normally I where the F-Lite 195 or 230's and love those shoes. I was a little reluctant to order theses shoes in fear that they would feel clunky (like motion control shoes), but I would go to say that I like these more so than that other inov8 shoes that I have. There's more grip, and overall just feel better. Not to say the other inov8's are bad in anyway. Perfect for those workouts with running and dead lifting (because of the flat sole). Love them. They do tend to run a half size big.
I love these shoes! I'm addicted to Inov-8 shoes now. I started with the Women's 238 until they wore down, but these are just as good. The only down side is that you really have no tread. So you cannot really take these off road and they do wear down pretty quickly. I wear my standard 1½ sizes above street shoes.
