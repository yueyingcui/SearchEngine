ASICS Kids Gel-1170 PS (Toddler/Youth)
Great sneaker!  They run small so I had to order two sizes up for our 4 year old. Strong Velcro; however, they need to really undo the strap vs slipping their foot in because the heal cushion crushes easily. A little pricy but happy with the quality. The shipping and customer service is spot on!
Cute sneaker, but in my opinion, runs a full size small.  My daughter takes a 12 in other sneaker brands, and I could not even get the size 12 on her foot.  When comparing lengths of the sneakers sole to sole, the Asics is much shorter, despite claiming to be a 12.
