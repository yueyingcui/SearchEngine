adidas Copa Mundial
These are excellent shoes. Make sure to buy one size smaller than your gym shoe size. They are made of kangaroo leather that is mean to stretch around your foot. If you do not allow for this, it will peel up around the front of your toes and wear down quicker.
These run big! Believe what others say and go down a full size. I wear a 11.5 and ended up getting a 10.5 for a proper fit. It takes a couple practices or one game to stretch them out to the size the will be normally. A great shoe!
Quality shoes without the flashy bells and whistles of other types.  Be forewarned, if you wore Nike's get a smaller size adidas.  I wore total 90's  size 10.5 and Copas fit me best at 9.5. The weight of the shoe is a little more than some people like, but I enjoy the solid footing they provide. This is what a soccer shoe should be.
Very good soccer boot. I ordered my true size. It stretched a bit, so order a half size down.
Stretched a bit after the first time he used them. Was a bit upset, but is getting a smaller size. He love the shoes; he plays in a soccer team and hated not being able to wear them.
I have trouble finding soccer cleats in mens size 15 -- I've worn this style for my last 3 pairs.
Wonderful straight out of the box! I wear a woman's size 10.5 or 11 and these felt great. A man's 9.5 was way too big.
They fit very narrow; I had to buy two sizes smaller than my actual foot size so that the toes would fit like soccer cleats, but now the width strangles my circulation. Even with all that being said, these are wonderful shoes. The light-weight makes it feel as though you are barefoot. Plain look is refreshing and the sole is durable.
