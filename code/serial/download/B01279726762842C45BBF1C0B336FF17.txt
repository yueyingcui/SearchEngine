ASICS Kids Gel-KayanoÂ® 18 (Youth)
I am a 49 year old woman and I have been buying the girls Asics Gel Kayanos for as long as they have had them. Only having small feet I found the ladies size 5 were not fitting very well so I changed to the youth ones. A US 4 is my size. The only problem I have, and it is nothing to do with the shoes support or wear, is that I buy mine in Australia and get one choice of color. I love being bright and would love my shoes to reflect my personality. It is not just children that wear them and would love Asics to branch out and get funky with their colors. Enjoy your running everyone.
This shoe is excellent for standing all day at work. I'm a woman's size 7 1/2 to an 8 and the Youth size 6 fits great plus it was less then the woman's version. Granted you have to like pink but I work in pink scrubs so it's not a problem for me.
