adidas Originals SambaÂ® Leather 
I like these, have been wearing them a long time for casual wear. Poor quality/size control. I ordered size 9 1/2 to replace 9's that were a little snug. The new 9 1/2's are smaller than the old 9's.
These shoes are very comfortable. They run true to size, in my opinion, and they are stylish. I get compliments all the time since they are classics. I did encounter the squeaky noise from the tongue rubbing on the inner leather of the shoe. As recommended by others, just rub some lotion on the tongue and that takes care of it.
True to size, fits a narrow foot well. I use for weightlifting-squats/leg day. Really stiff shoe, requires break in and I am not there just yet, not quite as comfortable as a pair of old Puma shoes they replaced but will give it some time.
