Saucony Grid Ignition 3
These shoes are great, but run VERY SMALL. I usually wear an 8.5-9 and ended up with a 9.5 after sending back the first pair. Now that I have the right size, they are very comfortable, good amount of arch support.
I really like this shoe.  Feels true to size for a 10.5. I stand at work most of the time and feel these shoes have enough cushion and support to last through the day and prevent excessive fatigue.  Nice shoe!
I bought these shoes for my daughter. She has very wide feet, and it's difficult to find shoes that fit her, come in a wide size, and are cute! These are wonderful! 
Definitely a 1/2 size small! I have been wearing Saucony sneakers for 5 years and it is the very first time I am returning my usual size for a half size up. I wish I had read the reviews as somebody else said the same thing and they were right. This is the first time I am writing a review due to this problem, I hope it is helpful. They are super cute in the white/blue/citron.
Great shoe. Cushions well for running. I have narrow feet and find that this fits well without having to spend extra on narrow shoes. Probably fits narrow everywhere but especially in the heel.Length seems true to size but may seem smaller due to fitting narrow. Fit better than other Sauconys I have spent much more money on.
Runs a full size small at least.  I have been wearing Saucony sneakers for years and couldn't believe how tight these were.
