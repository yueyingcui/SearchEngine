Nike Nike5 Elastico Pro
If you want compliments, order this pair of shoes. They are bright enough to be seen across the room or across the city. Complete strangers stop me because they are in awe. Having said that, I ordered true to size - a 9 and had to return for a 9 1/2. In reality I could have used a 10. This shoe for me runs very small. Still working on breaking them in for that reason. They also seem narrower than the size indicated.
A very good pair of indoor soccer shoes. At first it feels like it's not true to size, but it got bigger once I used it for a week or two. Very comfortable after that. Also provides you with very beautiful and delicate touches on the ball. Recommended for beginners and also professionals.
