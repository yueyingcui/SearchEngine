PUMA Voltaic 3 NM Wn's
I bought this shoe in a half size larger than I normally do, just because I typically wear a 9.5 in sneakers rather than a 9. I put it on, walked around for a while and it was slipping terribly on my heel. I love the color ( I ordered the funky blue color), but alas these need to go back. Not my favorite Puma purchase and it probably won't be the last. They also look a little bulky, or fat on my foot (looking down). Shoot, I wanted these to work!
These shoes are so pretty! I bought them for my daughter for school, which she starts next week. Unfortunately, I now have to wait for a credit, which I do not think I will get in time. They are really narrow, and my daughter does not have wide feet! All of her shoes are regular size! Also, I ordered a 7Â½, which it seems she would definitely need an 8. I guess I will be waiting to get her the shoes she needs for school. Otherwise, I suppose I would recommend, but beware!
