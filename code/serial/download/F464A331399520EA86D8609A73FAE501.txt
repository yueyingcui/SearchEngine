New Balance MC804
I bought these in a 9 EE for my father, who usually wears an 8.5 EEE (but it is so hard to find tennis shoes in that size I took a chance on these). He says that length-wise they fit true to size (meaning these, in a 9, were a bit long for him), but width-wise they were perfect. New Balance tend to run wide, so I'm not surprised. They offer him good support and they are made of quality material. Game, set, match!
These shoes are great. I bought them because I have a narrow foot and they offer a B size. I play tennis once a week.
It is a good shoe and it fits by feet very well. It replaces one of the same model and size that wore out.
I like its feel and the support it gives me.
I only wear New Balance shoes because they make them in narrow sizes to fit my feet, but these MC804s are the worst I ever bought. My heels hurt for days. I thought it was just new shoes but my feet stopped hurting after wearing my old New Balance shoes.
Good quality and true to size. Much better build than the other NB models at lower prices. Liked them so much I bought a backup pair.
