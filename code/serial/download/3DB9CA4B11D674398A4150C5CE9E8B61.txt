New Balance MX20V2
Not really sure what NB was thinking this time around. There is very little resemblance between the the first and second version MX20's. The v2's are much narrower in the toe than the originals. This completely voids the roomy toe box of the v1's, which was an awesome feature. NB used a lot of plastic material on the v2's, making them just look and feel cheap. I was really looking forward to these after not having much luck in finding the size/color I wanted in originals. Sent these back immediately. Thankfully, I did eventually find a pair of the v1's. If you do try these, NB has corrected the running small sizing issue of the v1's. Order your regular size. I definitely recommend not wasting your time with the v2's and just getting the v1's, if you can find your size/color choice.
