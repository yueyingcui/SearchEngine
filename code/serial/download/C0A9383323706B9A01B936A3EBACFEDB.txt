adidas Y-3 by Yohji Yamamoto Kubo
Hi! I really like this shoes and can you tell me how much the prize including the postage? And I need size 9 U.S or 9.5 U.S and I live in Australia...
Finally - a velcro shoes that doesn't look like an orthopedic or a toddler's shoe.  I love these so much that I got an extra pair, since I know I'll wear them out.  The sizing seems a bit weird, but I'm a US 6/EU 36 and the smalls fit perfectly (despite being sized for anything between 5-6.5).  
They run small. Other then that, they are perfect. I love them. Wouldn't take 'em back. If you like this type of sneakers, then buy 'em. Just buy 1 size bigger than you would wear, and that will do it.
