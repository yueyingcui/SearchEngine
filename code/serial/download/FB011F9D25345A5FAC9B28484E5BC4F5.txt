Salomon XR Crossmax Guidance
Runs 1/2 size too big. I normally wear 12...had to drop to 11.5. Very stable supportive shoe. Loose in the heel with no way to secure it. hopefully this goes away over time as I'm sure the heel slip is being caused by the stiffness of the shoe.
This shoe feels very stable and supportive; however, the shoe does feel a bit bigger than a size 11 and heavy.
This is my third pair of Salomans. Without a doubt the best so far. Compared to the Speed Cross and XT Wings 2. Love the larger toe box with sensiflex. They look great and feel even better, ready to run right out of the box. As with all Salomans go half a size larger then normal and you will be golden. Buy these shoes!
