Puma Kids V5.11 I FG Jr (Toddler/Youth)
My daughter loves these shoes. I took the other reviewer's advice and ordered a full size up. I am glad that I did. They do run small, but they are super cute.
I was glad I had read reviews to know that these shoes run very small, so I ordered larger sizes to try than I would have normally.  This shoe in size 4 fit the same as the Nike T90 in size 3.  My daughter is very happy with the blue and lime green colors, and she says they're comfortable.
They seem to fit tight compared to my daughters other shoes. We even went a 1/2 size bigger than what she currently wears. The overall quality is nice.
