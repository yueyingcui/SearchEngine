Keen Howser
I love Keen but these shoes hurt the back of my foot like crazy! I bought them for work but the first day I wore them, they started cutting into the back of my heel and made me bleed just in the 10 minutes of walking in them. I had to smash the back down and walk on them as if they were a slip on. I'd order a size bigger with these.
I love these, I wear them all day when I'm at home. I bought my hubby a pair and he loves them. True to size and great comfort.
I love these shoes (yes I wear them as shoes, not just slippers). They are totally comfy and great for running around town.  But, beware of two things: they run a half size small, and they really do not have any support.   I always wear a size 8.5 and I had to return them and get a 9 in these.
I ordered the size I wear. Size 9. I have long toes. The shoes fit perfectly. Very comfortable. Fit is snug (but not tight) like a glove. My husband says they look like slippers. I'm surprised a shoe horn didn't come with the shoes. You will need one to get them on. This is my first pair of Keen's. I hope they hold up well, because they were pricey.
These are great shoes. Very comfortable. The lining keeps my feet warm, without being too hot. They do run small. I had to return the first pair that were my usual size as I couldn't even get them on! I'm think of getting another pair or 2 in other colors. Highly recommend this product. Keen has never let me down!
