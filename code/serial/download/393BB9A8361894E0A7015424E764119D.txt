Converse Kids Chuck Taylor® All Star® Street Mid Slip (Infant/Toddler)
These are elastic shoe laces and tongue have elastic too plus tongue is padded. Super cute they will need socks for sure unless foot is VERY wide love them though Converse run a full size bigger then Nike check out converse.com we always order a size down though.
