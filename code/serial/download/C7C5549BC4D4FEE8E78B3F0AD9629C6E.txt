Ryka Reviveâ„¢
Bought a pair of these at a local dept store and loved them. They have a wider toe bed and a great arch compared to Nike, Adidas and Reebok...I no longer have foot or toe cramping. 7-1/2 are usually a smidge too small and 8's are usually a smidge too big. Ryka size 8 fit me perfectly! When I saw them on sale I bought 2 more pair.
I love Rykas. There's no breaking-in the shoe to make them comfortable. They are comfortable from the beginning. These have large air holes in the mesh for great circulation. May be too airy for winter. Not sure yet. I do always buy a half size bigger than my normal with Ryka, and they fit perfect.

These shoes are great. They fit true to size and work really well for step class and moving side to side. Good support.

These shoes fit great and are very comfortable. However, I'm a distance runner and these shoes are a bit bulky for my taste. I can run on a treadmill just fine, but when I'm outdoors I tend to stumble over the shoe size a bit. I'm sure this is something anyone can get used to though, but I would not recommend these for even light trail running.
Great shoe for walking and gym.  Lightweight, well-cushioned.  The style isn't too bulky and looks modern.  Can't beat the price.  I found they fit true to size with ample room in toe box. I ordered in blue/lime and get compliments nearly every time I wear them.
