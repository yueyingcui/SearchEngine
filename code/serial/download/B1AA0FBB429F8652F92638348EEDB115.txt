Pearl Izumi W Kissaki 2.0
Trendy shoe. Great color combination. Realized too late that I should have ordered a half size up. I'm a 9.5 and my toe pokes up at the top. i'd rate these 5 stars had I ordered the right size for me.
I used to run in Pearl Izumi Cruise but they were discontinued a while ago and I've struggled to find the right pair for me since. I have wide feet, moderate arch and a neutral stride. My toes LOVE these. The seamless upper means nothing's rubbing on the inside or outside of my toes. The upper material is flexible, so it moves with your foot. The cushioning is perfect for me. I don't like to sink into a shoe. They are a little flashy for me, but I think that's the trend right now. I don't really care for the style but I have also never chosen a running shoe based on design, so that won't affect my overall rating. I am currently training for a marathon and and really glad I found these now. They recommend you order a half size up...and many runners already wear a half size up in running shoes. If you are one of those people, yes, you will need to order a whole size up. I'm an 8.5 street shoe, 9 is most running shoes and I need a 9.5 in these.
