Vivobarefoot Neo L
Shoes fit great. Comfortable & stylish. They run a little small, so order one size larger.
Adorable shoes but run a size small. Luckily I have a friend's birthday coming up and they will fit her perfectly. :)
A great barefoot shoe. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a bare minimum sole who wants to get in touch with the ground and feel more balanced. I was unsure whether my wide feet would fit in this shoe but I've been very pleased with how it fits. Just make sure to order a half size larger than you normally would, it runs smaller like most running shoes. You definitely want that extra space in the front of the shoe, it adds to the comfort. I wear these things everywhere. :)
I heart this shoe! It is perfection. It is comfortable and cute. They are very light weight. I use it to workout and walk my dog. A wonderful shoe for New York or for walking around your favorite city in Europe. I usually wear a 9 1/2-10. 9 1/2 fits perfectly. So if you are in between sizes go to smaller size. Your feet will thank you! 
Had to size up but they are great comfort. No break in period at all. I hate tennis shoes but can wear these through workout and walk without difficulty.
I tried 6 different pairs and sizes of Vibro and none fit my narrow foot.  My toes just crashed into the front.  The Jambu fit better.
Also, the toe height is not enough if you have a big toe that tends to roll up.
