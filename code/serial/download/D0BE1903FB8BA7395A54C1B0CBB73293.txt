New Balance WT510v1
The size of the shoe says 9.5 W on the tongue of the shoe.  This is the size I wear, but could not get my foot into the shoe.  Either the shoe size runs extremely small or the labeled size is incorrect.
I ordered the 9.5 in a wide width the normal size I wear. Got the shoe, it said 9.5 on the tongue of the shoe, but I couldn't even get my foot in the shoe. I measured the shoe length with a couple of my other 9.5 and this shoe was at least 1 inch shorter than my other 9.5 sizes. The shoe has to be mis-sized. The shoe is going back.
Lots of support and cushion! I had to order 1/2 size larger, could have even gone a full size larger.
Excellent fit. I bought a half size up plus wide because I have very wide feet. They fit perfectly. Excellent product.
Very comfortable and true to size. I'm out of shape and a beginning runner and haven't had any blisters or sore feet. Would buy again.
These shoes are really comfortable, great for running indoor/outdoor or even casual dress. I wear and ordered a 7.5, wish I would've ordered a 7 though, runs .5 size too big.
