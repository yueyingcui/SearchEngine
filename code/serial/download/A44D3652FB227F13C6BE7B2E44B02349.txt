Sperry Top-Sider Starboard
Okay, so I've had these shoes for a couple of months now. I can honestly say that they are perhaps the best "athletic" shoes I've ever owned. I'm typically really girly when it comes to shoes, but my job isn't very glamorous, so I had to find an athletic-y shoe to wear in a warehouse environment in which I'd be on my feet all day. I stumbled across the shoe, and I didn't think they were hideous (and I think nearly all sneakers are hideous). When they first arrived, they were a bit stiff, but after about a week they were entirely broken into and much more comfortable. Not much arch support if it's something you need, you could probably get orthopedics for it. But here are my favorite things about these shoes: Number 1: They don't squeak on any type of floor, which is a big deal to me. I feel so awkward when I wear squeaky shoes. 2: They aren't bulky like a typical athletic shoe, they actually make my feet look smaller (I'm a size 8.5). 3. They are Navy. I thought at first I wouldn't like it, that it would make it harder to color coordinate, but I really do like the navy and have found ways to incorporate it into my everyday wardrobe. 4. They are true to size for me. Everyone always says you need to order a size smaller with Sperry's. I didn't have to do that. My size is typically an 8.5, and so I ordered 8.5 and they fit perfectly. Just let them break in a little.
