Brooks PR LD
After trying on 6 sets of spikes, my daughter liked the Brooks the best.  Not too stiff, not too flimsy.  She has narrow feet with a high arch and these were just right.  They run small.  In Nike she wears an 8.5, and the 9.5 was the right size in these spikes.  She runs primarily the mile and 2 mile.
My daughter loves the shoes, but I had to get her 2 1/2 sizes up.  They run really small.   
My daughter loves her shoes! We got them in time for her meet, and she says they fit great. We did order a half size bigger than what we do with other brands.
