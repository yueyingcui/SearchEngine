Circa Crip
Cool looking shoes, love the basic styling but if you're planning on wearing these with socks you need to go up at least a half size.
Very nice shoes... Recommend buying a half size larger than your normal shoe size.
So I agree with these feeling at least half a size smaller. I wish that I had read the reviews before I ordered! Unfortunately I did not figure out that they were too small before I wore them outside. Bummer. But I liked them so much that I have ordered two pairs a size up, although they are out of the nice brown ones I originally purchased.
Great shoes...but you should get half a size bigger than you think! Otherwise it'll run a little tight and you'll either be forced to return it or deal with it.
These are really nice shoes. They look great! The one problem is that I am a size 11, sometimes a size 12. I got these shoes in size 12 and they do not fit. I will be sending them back for the next size up.
Great shoes. True to size. Very comfortable as well.

Very clean simple shoes. It's a great alternative to Vans Authentics since the quality is higher (with a lower price). There are no loose ends or choppy rubber tags on the sole of the shoe. I agree with the other reviewer who claims the shoes run small. I normally wear a 10.5 but I would be better suited to a size 11 with these Crips.
Great shoe, but it does fit about a half-size too small. I'd recommend ordering up a half-size. They're also a bit narrow, so you may have to stretch them out. Worth it, though.
I love these shoes and they look great with shorts or jeans. Only complaint is a fixable one. The sizes run a tad small, so you might want to order up a half or whole size from your usual.
The shoes fit well, true to size and look great. My only gripe is that the toe area isn't very flexible and looks a little strange. Other than that I have no complaints.
