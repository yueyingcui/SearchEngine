It's real leather and has velcro closures.  Not too many like that.  Bought it to replace my NB velcro walking shoes, which are made of vinyl or whatever they make fake leather out of.  Frustrated that there's no wider shoe available in my size (mens 7.5).  Not sure if this is going to work for me long-term.  The toe area will need to stretch out for it to be comfortable.  We'll see.
