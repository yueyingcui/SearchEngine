adidas Originals Gazelle
My favorite shoes from Adidas! They're very comfortable and great for dancing, I've bought several pairs in different colorways. Very clean and classic look. I would suggest getting a half size up if you have wide feet. Otherwise it fits nicely. Highly recommended!
I found this shoe to be slightly, very slightly larger than size because it is a man's 4 and woman's 5, it's kind of a unisex size. I am a true woman's size 5 so this shoe did run a little big...but it is still absolutely wearable and very comfy! I would recommend this shoe.
This is a great looking shoe and comfortable. The only problem is my size was sold out, so I thought I could go one size down like I have in the past with other shoes, but these shoes actually run a little small, so I have to return them. Too bad the half size up from mine is sold out too. :(
