Nike Kids JR T90 Shoot IV TF (Toddler/Youth)
I purchased these for my 8yr old son. He likes the way they look and fit true to size. The only problem is the laces are not very long and therefore makes it a little difficult for him to tie.
My 9 year old is very particular when it comes to sneakers/cleats, but he loves these sneakers! Bright, comfortable and just enough traction for an indoor football league. Sizing is accurate. Sneaker is lightweight and comfortable. He put them on as soon as they arrived (about an hour ago) and doesn't want to take them off. Great sneaker! Thinking about getting another pair in a larger size to be prepared when he outgrows his current size.
