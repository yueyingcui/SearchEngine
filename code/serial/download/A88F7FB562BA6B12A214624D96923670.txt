New Balance WC804
I measure a 7.5 but the size 8D felt a bit tight in the toe box. The width was fine and this shoe would fit well if I ordered an 8.5 D.
This feel great on my feet. I wear size 11 in any other shoe (dress or casual) that I purchase but in these I had to go up one size.
Yes! Finally, a comfortable sport shoe for my narrow foot. Thank you, New Balance, for carrying narrow sizes -- and being made in the USA!
These are good quality tennis shoes. They run slightly small, so size up if you are in between sizes. I've only worn them twice, but they were comfortable the first time playing tennis with them. I wish New Balance jazzed up the look a bit, but these look nice in a classic way.
Narrow shoes size 10 are hard to come by.  I have had four pair of New Balance WC804s
They are comfortable with great support.  I wear them playing hard courts. The shoe is solid and keeps me from rolling my ankle especially side to side motion.  
This is my second pair of these shoes.  I like New Balance because I have a wide foot and they fit nicely.  I do buy 1/2 size up, however.  Could be that I need to for the thick socks that I wear.  
My daughter loves this shoe. She has very wide feet from bunions. As she grows, we keep getting the next size up. I would highly recommend this shoe.

More often than not, supposedly "wide" shoes don't begin to fit me. This extra wide size really does.
