Nike Kids Pico 4 (Infant/Toddler)
Great shoes! Comfortable and durable - my son has been wearing them for 8 months and they are still in good shape. Run half size larger. I only give 4 stars for style because I wish they came in darker colors too - black, navy blue. The white looks nice, but it's hard to clean. I am still buying the next size up, though!

I absolutely love these sneakers, they seemed very comfortable, stylish and I love the Velcro for toddlers! Unfortunately size 10 felt larger because my son currently wears a 10 in Adidas so I ordered both 9 & 9.5 and am looking forward to my shipment.
Very cute, but run a little big.  My son was in a size 4 Puma shoe before I bought these.  The Nike 4.5 size is a lot bigger.  They still work though and has lots of room to grow.  
My 3 year old daughter loves these shoes. Very comfortable for her daily wear to school and the black color is easy to clean, just dust off. Would definitely recommend it. I ordered 1/2 size so that they last slightly longer bigger and that worked for her.
Great shoes! Very durable and nice looking. I bought these for my daughter in size 6 and again next season in size 8. She loved them!
These shoes are wonderful. They have great support and I love the Velcro. They fit fat little fat well but definitely order at least a half size up if you are buying for growing feet. My 1 year old daughter normally wears a 5 with plenty of room but this shoe in a 5 fit perfectly with very little room. I should have bought a 6.
