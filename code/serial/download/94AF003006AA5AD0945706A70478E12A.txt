adidas Kids SambaÂ® Classic Core (Toddler/Youth)
My son has worn these shoes for many years. They are excellent quality, fit true to the size and are comfortable. They are also very stylish. They look good with shorts or jeans. You cannot go wrong with this classic Adidas.
I bought this shoe for my 8 year old daughter for school. The shoe is very stylish and comfortable per my 8 year old daughter. This shoe is true to size and I do plan on purchasing another pair for her and maybe myself too.
Very happy with this purchase. True to the size. Feel great and look great. My son loves them and wants to wear those every day. 
I love these shoes they fit me a little big but I wear double sock and I use them for soccer. I wear a 7.5 women shoe size but its okay. I love them.
I love these shoes! My son is 9 1/2 and is very hard on his shoes. These are the perfect muli-function shoe. These are a great everyday shoe; they are easy to clean; they can be used for indoor soccer; they look good with skinny jeans. They are more water resistant that suede skate shoes or running shoes. They are true to size. I will buy these again!
Great shoes for my 7 year old girl! Fit true to size.
