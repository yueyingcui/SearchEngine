Fallen Patriot II
I ordered this shoe for my son (age 15) and he loves it.  He is a skater and needed new shoes because the previous ones were completely shredded!  The color lime green is spectacular (he originally wanted blue which was sold out, but likes the lime even better!!)  It is true to size.  He could not be more pleased.
