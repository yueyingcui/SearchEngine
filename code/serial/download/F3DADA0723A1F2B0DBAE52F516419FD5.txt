Nike Tenkay Slip TXTL
Very cute and comfortable, if you get right size. I usually wear 6.5, after check others review I ordered size 7. Still very tight. However, they are too cute to return so I gave them to my mom, size 6. She loves them.
Too tight.  I ordered a 0.5 size up, but still major rubbing at the ankle.  Returning and not reordering!  
These flats are super cute. I'm normally a size 6, but I ordered a 6 1/2 as per other reviewers' advice. Unfortunately, they still my made toes feel squished/numb after a few hours on my feet and pinched the back of my ankles for the first few wears, so I wish I had gone up a full size. I love that you can remove the ankle straps, so that's a huge plus.
After reading reviews I decided to order these shoes half a size larger and a full size larger. Normally, I am a perfect size 10B, but these shoes run very short. I tried on the 10Â½ and they were clearly too small. The size 11 fit in length and width, but my toes felt more squished than I would prefer. However, the deal breaker was the elastic digging into my Achilles tendon. It was painful just to look at them in the mirror. I am sure that is a placement thing and YMMV with that one.
