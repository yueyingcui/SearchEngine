Zipper does not always zip smoothly. Also, after a few weeks of wearing this shoe - it begins to stretch almost a half size larger. Comfortable support after your foot molds its imprint to the shoe.
Awesome! Love them...they do feel like a slipper. I wear a 9 to a 9 1/2 and I would recommend getting your size. They are so comfy! I would highly recommend if you like comfy shoes!
