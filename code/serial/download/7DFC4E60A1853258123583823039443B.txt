Nike Zoom Rival MD 6
These are about half a size too small. I got a 6Â½ and they felt really tight. They are good for jumping and mid-distance events, (300 hudles, 400, 800.) I reccomend breaking them in before your first race, as they are stiff.
I agree. We ordered a 4.5 and they were way too small. I would suggest ordering a size larger than you normally take. Other than that they're awesome!
Great shoes, however they run about a 1/2-1 size small. I am a size 8 normally and that felt like a size 7. Other then that great product!
Order a half size bigger! And you will be fine, these shoes made me run my first 2 mile at an 11:57.79! They are very snug and light, and there are 7 spikes which feel awesome on the rubber tracks. I have yet to test it on an asphalt track, but I'm sure they'll be fine as well. Love them!
Great looking shoe, felt great if you forgo how small it felt around my toe. Make sure to order a half size larger!
