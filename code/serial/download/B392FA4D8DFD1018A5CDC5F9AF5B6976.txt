PUMA PUMAGILITY Speed 2 Wn's
I wanted new sneakers primarily for Zumba class, but all the Nike shoes I found were a lot more expensive. I didn't even think of Pumas at first until these popped up on the list of sneakers on sale. I have other Pumas (non-athletic), some of which are 8 1/2 and some of which are 9. I ordered both sizes in this sneaker and the 8 1/2 are perfect. The shoes are super light and were immediately comfortable. Great deal!
