Reebok Lifestyle Classic Nylon
Great shoes for everything, even running and a casual evening with jeans. Truefit for me, perfect size 12. I already want a new fresh pair.
Great durable and comfy shoe. Looks great as a retro runner! Can't go wrong with this shoe. Fits true to size (at least for me).
I love the classic look of this shoe.  Casual, comfortable, and doesn't stand out too much.  My shoes came with two sets of laces (gray and black) so that you could pick which color  you wanted.  The size does seem to run small.  I always wear size 13 in all shoes and have never had an issue with sizes, but this shoe felt more like a size 12.
Although these shoes are marked as wide they aren't. They feel smaller than they are; my toes come out to the right place, but the narrow toe box makes it feel like my foot is crammed in there. They look cool and are lightweight, so I'm hoping once they break in a little more they'll fit better. Might get a 1/2 size bigger in the future. 

I love the look of these shoes. Unfortunately, the size definitely is smaller than labeled, especially with regard to the width. Note that even though the size on the site says EE, the actual shoe/box labeling does not indicate width at all, so these are standard width. In fact, they only come in one width, so this should be a hint that their idea of wide is meant to fit the average person. Order a larger size, or if width is a concern, look elsewhere.
