SIDI Dominator 5 Women's
Fantastic shoes!! Very stiff, responsive, and super durable. The straps make for a customizable fit and are easily micro-adjusted while pedaling because of the ratchet buckle. The ratchet also allows you to really crank them tight on technical terrain when you want to make sure you can exit your pedals quickly! This is my second pair of these shoes...I only gave up the first pair because my feet have grown a half size. They thrived through 11 years of substantial use and were still going strong! These will last forever and are worth every penny.

I bought these a couple weeks ago because of so many recommendations from friends and family.  They were right.  These are great cycling shoes and definitely worth the price.  My husband has a pair that has lasted for years.  Very comfortable cycling shoe; very adjustable.  Highly recommend. I did order about a 1/2 size up.
