Osiris NYC83 VLC
The sizes are inconsistent. It makes no sense. I bought a 6.5 for my son and were too small. I measured them against his older Osiris' which were size 6 and actually slightly longer. It's the only brand he'll wear but now I feel I have to go to a store to buy them. Too bad because stores don't have the same selection.
It felt half size bigger but I love the room the shoes have! Amazing shoes. I didn't order these shoes; I have LA Lakers one but they're my most comfortable shoes I own. Downside is the inserts are very easy the tear apart after a while. Other than that best shoes ever!
Great service. My grandson loved his Osiris sneakers. They look just like the picture, and the size was perfect.
These shoes are awesome. I've worn them for about three weeks and there is little to no sign of wear. The interior is really padded and a pleasure to walk in. There are 2 downsides. One is that they aren't very breathable so your feet get kind of hot after 6 hours or so, and they aren't that flexible for a vulc shoe, but they are better than a cupsole design. I would recommend buying a size small because I wear a size 15 and my size 14 fit just fine.
