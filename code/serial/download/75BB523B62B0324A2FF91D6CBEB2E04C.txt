PUMA El Ace L
Good looking shoe that goes with a lot of different styles. Runs true to size but doesn't have much cushion for your foot. Good stylish, casual, walk around shoe.
I'll start off by saying that I have a wide foot and that's one of the main reasons this shoe and I had problems. The shoe looks amazing, yet it was a little tight around my foot even though I bought a size larger than I normally wear and it constantly rubbed up against my heel causing pain shortly after walking.
This shoe fit really great from day one. It is very flexible right out of the box, so it does not require breaking in. My foot is an average width size 13. Love 'em.
