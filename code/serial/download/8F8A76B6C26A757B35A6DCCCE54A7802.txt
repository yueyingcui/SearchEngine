adidas Turf Hog LX Mid
My son, who now wears a size 14, was very disappointed to find that all of the local retail stores don't stock anything larger than a 13. He has had good experience with Adidas cleats and needed a style that worked well in turf. He says that these perform perfectly and the fit is excellent.
