Saucony Hattori LC
I concur on theses being true to size. My last two pairs of running shoes were Nike frees. I have also yet to run in these, but they feel amazing so far.

I'm mad that Nike has basically abandoned the "free" principle. Yes, I know they still make frees--but now with wayyy too much support. These hattori lc's feel like the future. I can't wait to run in these. Just jogging around my apartment tells me that these encourage a mid-foot strike. Shame on all the shoe mfgrs for forcing heel strikes for the past 40 years. I will update soon.  
I wanted to write a very quick review to address the small size comments related to the other version of this shoe. I ordered the new LC's in a size 10 at first after reading that the original Hattori's all ran .5-1 size too small. Well it turned out they must have fixed the issue in the LC version. I had to return and order a 9.5 instead(My actual size). They fit perfectly now! If you order this updated version of the shoe, make sure to order your regular size. :). Will update later on the actual feel after running for a bit.
