New Balance Kids KL525 (Toddler/Youth)
My daughter loves these shoes so much that I tried to order a second pair up a size but they were sold out.   The only negative is that the laces are a bit slippery so when she ties them herself they tend to come undone.  With double knots this problem is solved.
