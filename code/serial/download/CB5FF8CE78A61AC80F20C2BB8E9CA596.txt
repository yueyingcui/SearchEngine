Avia A9616W
I usually like Avia shoes. I got these for casual shoe use. I like the non aggressive look. These shoes have some of the best arch support I have come across, even in more expensive shoes. This is important to me because I have a mild neuropathy. I would probably not wear these shoes as an everyday work shoe but for casual wear half a day it has worked out perfectly for me. If you like wearing heavy socks, get half a size larger.
