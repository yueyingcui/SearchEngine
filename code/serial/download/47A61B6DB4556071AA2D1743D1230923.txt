The North Face Women's Base Camp Sneaker (Canvas)
Very happy with this cute canvas sneaker from North Face.  Was looking for a Chuck Taylor type sneaker with more support and found it in this shoe.  This shoe is more supportive that CT's, with a foam pebbled footbed for support and comfort. The toe cover is thicker, more durable rubber than the CT's too.  Runs one size large, so size down for a better fit. Very comfortable, cute, and sturdy sneaker.
