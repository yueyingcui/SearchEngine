Nike Action Kids Ruckus Mid Jr 6.0 (Toddler/Youth)
I got these shoes for my 8yr old son and they are too cute! They are sized a little small, so I would recommend going a half size up. Otherwise love them!
I love them and my son loves them! The fit is true to size and they are nice for the winter weather!
