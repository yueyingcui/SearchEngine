UGG Evera Canvas
I just received these today in exchange for a pair of Vans that I returned. I was looking for a casual neutral-colored shoe (Sugar) with arch support. Can't say there's a great deal of arch support, but they're quite a bit lighter than the Vans (8 oz. versus 12 oz.). They look really cute and I love the fleece around the opening so I can wear them without socks without getting blisters. I got size 7.5, my normal size, and the width is a little snug, but I actually like that because most shoes are too wide for me. I'd get another pair in pink if they were a little less expensive.
These ran about half a size small but are unbelievably comfortable. I will return these and get a larger size.
I loved the look of these as soon as I saw them. I as always against ugg but I gave up when I had such pain in my feet from working long days. I finally gave in to giving them a shot. I now have 3 pairs of boots and now these to get me through the warmer seasons. I took the traditional ugg advice and ordered a half size smaller than my normal size. I also measured my foot and compared it to ugg's size conversion chart. The sneakers fit like a glove. No rubbing or toe scrunching. They do not have room for a sock so its perfect for those who don't want to wear socks with their uggs. If you want socks I probably would suggest ordering your reg size or go up a half size.
Love Ugg slippers but was disappointed when I received these as the first pair of Ugg sneakers I have purchased. The right shoe wasn't made right as the spacing for the laces was uneven resulting in a tightness in the toe area even though they were a little too big. The pink linen pictured is darker than appears also. They just were not flattering on a big-footed person such as myself. I wear a size 12M and the design of these made my feet look huge. I felt like I was wearing clown shoes. I will stick to slippers and boots with this brand. Unfortunately I will be returning these shoes.
