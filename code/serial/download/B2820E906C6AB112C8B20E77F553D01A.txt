New Balance BB891
These shoes are everything they say they are, true to size and made well. I love them! I have had many compliments.
I miss the BB888 shoe.  If I knew they would quit making them, I would have bought 2 or 3 pairs.  The BB891 is narrower and less supporting than the BB888 was.  I wore a 13EE in the BB888 and the same size in the BB891 is too narrow and maybe a hair short.  I am going to wear it and hope it stretches out.
