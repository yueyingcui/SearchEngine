Keen Utility PTC Oxford
This shoe did not have the typical wide toe box and felt smaller than it's size. Not much to look at but I wanted a plain black work shoe anyway. It's getting returned.
I love these shoes - they look just like the picture. I do not think that they are really worth the price, but I do not have that many options in my size. They do run half a size small like the other reviews indicate - order half a size up like you would do for running shoes. For me, the smaller sizing is a good thing because my foot is a size 4Â½, and that is extremely hard to find in the slip resistant styles. The size 5 fits me perfectly. The slip resistance is excellent. My only complaint is that they do not have enough shock absorption as I would like, given that I walk on concrete all day. But the insoles are removable, so I will get my usual ProFoot 2-ounce miracle memory foam insoles.
Excellent customer service. I needed a 1/2 size larger. They shipped one out before they received my return. Shoe has great slip resistance as well as support and comfort.
Great shoe for food service! Firm, crisp strike with all day cushion. Definitely order from Euro size chart. Will be a little wide in toe box, but that gives nice stability in tight turning areas. I wear this with both shorts and pants and pound doubles in comfort. Also my left arch/fasciitis has improved since wearing this Keen. I'm picky about footwear and love this shoe.
