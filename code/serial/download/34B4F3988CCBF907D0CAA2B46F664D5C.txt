Nike Action Avid
Comfortable overall, although a little on the narrow side. I ordered a half size larger than I would have to help with that. The styling is nice too, not super eye grabbing like my red pair but a little unique with the blue sole.
First shoe besides Uggs I ordered online so I wasn't too sure what to expect.  The size was perfect and my favorite part of the shoe is the area by the tongue.  It is nice and wide.
