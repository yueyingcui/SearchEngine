ASICS Gel-170â„¢ TR
This is the best made athletic shoe I've ever had. The size is right and the shoe is very confortable. It's an ideal cross training shoe.
The shoes themselves are great. The return policy is even greater. Takes away all the concern about buying shoes that you have not actually tried on for fit. I am good about shoes and am comfortable with my size, but you never know what the manufacturer produces as your size. The ability to return after wearing around the house if great. And the price was also great. Good company to do business with.
