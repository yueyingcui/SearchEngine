SKECHERS Bikers - Dream-Come-True
Very lightweight (maybe too lightweight) and good looking. Took a little breaking in and thick socks are recommended for a few trouble spots (back of heel, small toe) but it improved after wearing a few times. True to size.
Thanks gang...love these shoes. I did not realize all I needed was a wider width which these shoes are. All these years I thought I needed a larger size until I found you guys. Thanks bunches.
The fit on this was so strange, size 6 was too small and 6.5 was so huge that I could not walk in it at all even with athletic socks. Maybe I just got an oddball 6.5. I am going to order a 6 again and see if I could stretch it out a bit. I have worn Skechers for years and 6.5 has always been a perfect fit. Hope that works because I really love this style and color.
Shoes do not run true to size for me. 8ww - too big. 7ww -- too small. I have an old pair of Skechers in 8ww, very similar to these but with mesh that fit perfectly but can no longer find in ww.
I've alwaays like Skechers so as usual these are so comfortable I can wear them all day and not have sore feet at the end of the day. I would highly recommend these shoes. They are true to size.
The shoe is great.  I have a narrow foot.  Had I been able to try the shoe on before I bought it, I would not have bought it.  The perfect fit for me would have been an 8 narrow, but of course that size is not available.  The lenghth runs a little short.
Love these shoes! They look super cute and are really comfy. If you wear regular gym socks then I would say go 1/2 size up. If you use thin socks or want to go barefoot then they are pretty true to size. I ordered another pair similar but in gray because I like them so much!
Not only are they cute, they are comfortable.   The size was true, and the fit was perfect.
