Privo by Clarks P-Tequini
Ran a little smaller than the white leather ones I bought in the same size. Comfortable shoes. I love the Privo Clarks brand. Lots of support.
The P-Tequinis are a little narrower in the forefoot than most of the shoes that I usually wear but they are not tight. The cushioning that the insole provides is really nice, especially in the heel area. I am on my feet 90% of the day at work (in a busy Medical Imaging department) and I really like wearing these to work. My feet are not tired or sweaty at the end of the day. Plus, they look sporty, too. I would buy another pair. I did have to buy a size smaller than other brands of shoes that I wear (7½ instead of 8½).
I normally wear a size 8 wide and this shoe is too big. I would return them but I wore them out before realizing how big they were. Wish they were a true size 8. 
These are great shoes. They are very comfortable and true to size. I consider these more dressy casual shoes.
I bought my first pair of these about six years ago (I have them in two colors) and I am only now replacing the pair that I wear the most.  The sole is flexible and durable and there is enough support that I wear them far more than my fancy athletic shoes.  I've received several compliments about them and am about to order a pair for my mother as a gift.

A note about the sizing:  I wear a 10.5 medium width, so I usually order an 11 because my size is rare.  In these shoes, I wear a 10 because the 11 was so long that the heel slipped a lot.  If they are a little snug at first, give them a week of wear and they'll stretch.
