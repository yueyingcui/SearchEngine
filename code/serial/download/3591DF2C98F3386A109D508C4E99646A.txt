Garmont Dragontail Lite
This is an extremely well-made shoe. It has a slightly larger and roomier toe box shape than the Garmont Sticky Boulder. I normally wear a size 12 D, but I had an earlier experience with the Garmont Sticky Boulder in which I started with a 12.5 D and ended up having to go to a size 13. Turns out, the sizing issue is the same for me with the Dragontail Lite, as the 13 fits nearly perfect. Even at that, I used a shoe stretcher to re-size the left shoe, as this is my larger foot. Approach-style shoes with lacing all the way to the toe are designed to fit snugly for better performance. The snug fit accentuates slight fit adjustment issues (not a complaint, just an observation).
The craftsmanship of these shoes is why I have chosen Garmont year after year. I have had their boots and their standard hiking shoes - adding these approach shoes to the mix will ensure I have quality shoes on me feet at all times. Buyer beware: You need to order 1 size up due to width (because of the lace-to-toe design).
