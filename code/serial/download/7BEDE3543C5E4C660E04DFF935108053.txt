Ektelon T-22 Mid
I'm very happy with the Ektelons so far. Prior to this I've been wearing New Balance tennis shoes. I've always liked NB for the comfort and availability in wide widths, but the soles would wear out fast and start coming apart. The Ektelons seem like they are much more suited for racquetball play and I feel like I'm moving better on the court. I tried ordering a half size bigger than normal, but ended up returning them for a full size bigger.
I wear a size 12 in other shoes, but ordered a size 13 and they fit perfect . Very comfortable, made well, and lots of details.
These sneakers are true to size (width and length) without socks but you'll probably need a pair that's one to one and a half sizes larger than your regular shoe size if you want these to fit comfortably with tube socks.  My shoe size is 9.5 regular width but I eventually settled for a 10.5 regular width (I should've gotten an 11) before I felt comfortable wearing them with my tube socks.
