New Balance W890v2
Great shoes, fit true to size, good support.  Everything I like about NB shoes.
I was miffed to learn I had to buy such a large size for proper running fit (1 full size larger than your normal) so I didn't think they would be comfortable. They are great! The size is perfect! They feel great! My feet don't hurt after my runs, I am no longer getting blisters, and they are light! So glad I bought them!
Great fit, good looking shoe, and true to size.  No blisters or discomfort from the time I opened the box to now (6 weeks later).  My favorite thing about these running shoes are that they are well cushioned but don't weigh down my feet.  Highly recommend!
Very comfortable shoe, started running in them as soon as I put them on.  Felt true to size and has good support.
Good quality shoe. Like that you can take out inserts and put in your own orthotics. Feels a little big for size. Will return try half size smaller than my usual.
1st I'm glad I didn't listen to the one Review that the shoe runs small. This sneaker is true to size. I wear 7 1/2 in Nike and bought the 7/12 in NB and they fit like a glove and I have wiggle room. The Yellow is more like a Neon Yellow which is perfect. I am totally happy.
Loved this shoe. The first time I put it on I went out and walked 4 miles and it felt great. Very true to size.
This shoe must have been a little larger than the others I have ordered in this size. After my walk I had a horrible blister from the heel sliding up and down. I wear a band-aid now when I wear them. 
Nice look but as usual, NB shoes are made in China and are never sized as stated-always smaller.
