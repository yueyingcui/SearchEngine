pediped Jake Grip 'n' Go (Infant/Toddler)
I don't understand the reviews here about this shoe fitting baby's chunky feet. I haven't purchased Pedipeds before so maybe I'm off about their sizing but I went by their size chart and it was a full size off. I couldn't even put my little guy's foot into this shoe. He doesn't have chunky feet either.
Love Pedipeds!  Just wish they made them in even bigger sizes for elementary school kids!
