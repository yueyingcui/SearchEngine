ASICS GEL-VolleycrossÂ® 3
I bought this shoe for my husband, size 10. For him, it runs true to size. He loves them. He says, they're comfortable. He has good traction on the vball court. I tried them on at the store and it wasn't for me. The toe part felt like it was missing sole.
Great shoe. The grip is possibly the best I have ever experienced and the fit is true to size.
