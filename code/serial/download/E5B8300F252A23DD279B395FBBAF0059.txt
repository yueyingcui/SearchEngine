Nike Lady Cortez Nylon
These are very retro stylish. Not supportive enough for sports. Returning for the next size up. 
I like this shoe, but it is an odd fit. I read other reviews and was glad I ordered a full size larger. The fit is very narrow. 
This is more of the '70s/'80s style Cortez and less cushiony style of the 90s. Still a great shoe, but I think I will have to get a pair of the men's Cortez for the other look and comfort. Like all Nikes, they run small, so order a half size up from the largest size you can wear. For example, the largest I can ever wear in a shoe is usually 9, so in Nike, I order a 9.5 and they are perfect. Also, this shoe is not for a wide foot.
My feet are average width. These shoes were way too narrow for me. My mother-in-law has difficulty finding shoes because her feet are so narrow and these were great for her. Too bad her foot is a size and a half smaller than mine or she would have kept them.
Super cute, but these run small. I'm pretty sure every pair of shoes in my closet is a size 7 and these were tiny! I'm not even sure a 7.5 would fit. More of a fashion shoe- very little arch support.

Not for the wide of foot. I love the way the shoe looks but it is cut fairly narrow. My wider foot simply would not fit. I wear a size 7.5 in women's normally. I couldn't make an 8.5 fit comfortably in the width. The men's cut is wider and has a higher toe/bridge area so a size 6 in mens ended up fitting me perfectly...too bad it doesn't have the cute pink option. In the men's, the shoe is a comfy and fun retro shoe for me.
