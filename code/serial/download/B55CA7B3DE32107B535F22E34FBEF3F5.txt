Nike Action Kids Ruckus Low Jr 6.0 (Toddler/Youth)
I purchased these for my 6-year-old son to wear to school.  He attends private school and has to wear all black, leather shoes.  He has another pair of these in a different color and loves them.  They are holding up good and he likes them.  I am very happy with my purchase! Buy a half size or full size bigger than what your child normally wears though.
Good looking shoe!  He loves them and wears them every day.  Fit true to size.

True to size, lightweight, stylish. My 13 year old loves them!
These are fabulous - especially for young SF Giants Fans! My son won't take him off his feet - ordering a spare pair in the next size up!
My 7 year old grandson fell for the color scheme of these shoes on-line, and his friends at camp like the look too. The fit is true to size, they wash well in the washing machine, and they're very lightweight. My grandson advises they help you run faster.
