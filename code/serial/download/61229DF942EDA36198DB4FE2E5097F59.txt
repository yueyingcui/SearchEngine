Nike Free Xilla TR
Love the style, size is true to fit.  I have pretty flat feet and these because of that did not work for me.
These are solid workout shoes. They are light, flexible, provide good traction and provide lateral support for high intensity workouts such as Insanity. I did get them half a size bigger, and it did take two or three workouts to break them in. At 205 pounds, I wanted shoes that would give adequate cushioning for plyometric work, and they do that as well. For the price, it would be difficult to find comparable shoes.
These shoes came true to size. They're great for those with a narrow heel.

I typically wear a 9 1/2 in Nikes, but had to return these and get a size 10. Even then, they felt snug and took about 6-7 wearings to break them in. I've had them 2 months now and they fit fine. Shoes look great too. They feel very light while working out.
