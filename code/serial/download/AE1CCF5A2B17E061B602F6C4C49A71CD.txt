My new favorite shoes! The cyan adds such an amazing contrast to these shoes. The shoes are light and moderately comfortable and feel true to size/width. I love them!
These are snug shoes. I have fairly flat feet, and was worried that these would have little arch support and flatten over time. But they have great support and have been my main shoes for six months. I want to buy another pair, but they are out of my size. These are great shoes. They are one of my all time favorites. They look good with everything.
Love the overall look and style of this shoe. Unfortunately, the sizing felt really off. I wear a size 12 in every other shoe, it felt like I was sent a 13 with way too much toe room. I really like the shoe, but it is definitely way too big to keep. Sad that I had to send back as they don't have a 11.5 size.
