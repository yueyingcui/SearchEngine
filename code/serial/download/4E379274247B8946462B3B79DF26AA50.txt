New Balance MW646
I like the shoes and good lookin' too. True to size. Seem to be very sturdy. Thought they looked better in hand than on computer.
I am a female who ordered these in a man's size.  Due to surgery on my foot, my Dr. recommended a man's shoe as it has a bigger toebox.  Even so, these shoes narrow more in the toe area than do the New Balance men's white walking sneakers.  With that being said, I merely loosened the shoe strings in the toe area, thus making them feel bigger on my toes.  Many people complained about the extra long shoe strings, but by my loosening the strings, that shortened them somewhat.  They are very comfortable to wear while walking or shopping!
I tried changing styles, same size, same brand. They hurt my left foot, so I sent them back. This was pretty easy, freight free (what a deal!). I re-ordered the shoe I used to have and they came in a very short time, and of coarse they fit great!
These are great shoes that are fantastically comfortable. Even at the end of 14 hours on my feet, a pretty standard day for me, I do not have any leg pain. I went with the extra wides because the mediums felt narrower than my other New Balance shoes. Do not let the extra wide size scare you, they fit like regular wides, which is perfect. I also bought a pair of Ecco Bioms at the same time and they gave me all kinds of trouble for more than double the price. Great value, here.
Absolutely love this shoe. My husband, son, and I all have a version of this shoe. It is a very durable trail type shoe. At the same time it is very comfortable and stylish. I have found that it runs about 1/2 size small in both woman's and man's sizes. Once you get into the larger sizes like my son (man's size 13 you need to order a whole size bigger since they don't do 1/2 sizes.)
