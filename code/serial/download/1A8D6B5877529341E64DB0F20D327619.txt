Vans Eraâ„¢ 
Great look and seem to be correct size. But buyer beware, the back heel of this shoe digs into your heel. Had blisters on back of heel after less than an hour of wear. Unfortunately, wore outside so can't return them. Would have otherwise.
These are nice comfortable/great looking shoes. I went with half a size larger than my usual, from a review that I read. That was a great idea.
I love this shoe. It is adorable; however I am usually a size 7 but to make sure it fit I ordered a woman's 7.5. When they arrived I couldn't even fit my foot in the shoe. They felt 2 sizes smaller than my other actual shoes that are size 7. Order 2 sizes bigger if you want them to fit.
Love Vans shoes. They have zero arch support or tread, but I love them anyway. They fit fairly true to size. If I hadn't worn them outside, I might have sent them back for a half-size bigger. The first day I wore them, it was rainy and decided to venture out in them and slipped down my steps, severely spraining my ankle. Beware to all buyers! Zero tread!
