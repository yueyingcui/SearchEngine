ASICS GEL-FujiRacerâ„¢ 
Great shoe, lightweight and true to size. I'm an average runner, mostly on city paved trails but this does the job on short runs. Love this shoe for everyday at work also when I'm on my feet. True to size and color rocks. I wear a 9 and on the narrow side of shoes.
This style feels smaller and more narrow than the same size and width of my other Asics shoes. Love the look and weight but back they go in exchange for a wider shoe.
