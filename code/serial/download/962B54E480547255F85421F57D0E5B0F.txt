The North Face Women's Single-Track GTX XCRÂ® II
Bought this shoe for long walks. Really liked the colors & styling, very breathable, good arch, material is not stiff, makes my feet look small, comfortable padding around ankle (but not too much for summer), and the medium width has a decent toebox for a narrow foot. But the length seems a half-size small as my toes bump against the tip, and the horizontal lining seam rubbed against my left ankle (but not my right). Sad to be returning it because it's such a nice-looking & great shoe otherwise.
