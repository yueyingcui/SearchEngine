Frye Greene Low Lace
As another customer mentioned, these shoes were quite large for my feet. Not sure if it's because I already wear a big size, but apparently these are a full size bigger than what I normally wear. It's unfortunate because I really enjoy the shoes and they were like a bolt from heaven in terms of the look, feel, and style that I want from a casual shoe. The distressing is even more beautiful in real life; the construction is flawlessâ€¦ totally classy shoe with this strange dystopian-western edge, but alas TOO BIG and mostly un-wearable. I will probably buy the orange/brown ones or maybe even another pair of the black that fit properly (yes, I like them that much!). I suggest getting padding or ordering a size down.

I would first like to say that Frye has some of the nicest leather around. Better than any baseball glove for sure. Anyhow, perhaps it's just me but I ordered a half size small cause for some reason I felt I had to. Tried them on and was bummed out because I should have ordered a full size smaller. It's okay because I am not too impressed by these, they are like a cross between some Chuck's and classic Vans but with a stiffer sole, but that leather is so soft.
My son bought a pair of leather sneakers in Spain and wore the soles off. I spent a long time looking for a replacement, and these ended up working great. 
He enjoys wearing them. We did have to swap for a half size larger.

Good shoe...a little lighter in color than it looks in the photo. Also, it seems to run about a 1/2 size too big... other than that, a nice and better quality alternative the the standard All-Star that everyone and their mother wears around.
