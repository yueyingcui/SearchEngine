Nike Vapor Strike Low TD 3
I purchased these for Ultimate Frisbee on a grass field. Provides excellent traction for cutting movements, particularly when the grass and ground are moist. The ankles are a bit higher than one would find on a soccer shoe, but I have not noticed that this is a liability. However, I do tend to wear socks with higher ankles than I would with a regular running shoe. Also, the toe is more comfortable than a soccer shoe as most soccer shoes seem to be symmetrical with respect to the toes for ball handling, rather than conforming to the natural prominence of the big and index toes. I can't say the shoe is particularly attractive, but I don't care much about that. I normally wear a 7.5, but bought these in a size 8, which feels good. I have played maybe 8 days with no obvious manufacture faults.
These have a great ground level feel. You should get half a size bigger then your normal shoe size. The only thing I do not like is that they are molded, but it is worth it.
