Aetrex ApexÂ® Rhino Runner
I use products of Aetrex since 2007 and I buy the products it a very very good product but right now I am looking for a pair of innersole size 8.5 shoe for my shoe but the seller of the store in Canada told me that I have to buy the shoe completely because the company don't sell innersole separately but my old one is still new but I also try the Aetrex Rhino Runner I see its very very good for me to work in the warehouse for 8 long hours and more because its stable and very comfortable better than other brand that I have use such as Reebok, Nike, Adidas. Please if you can help me it will be very appreciate, by let me have your company phone number by mail to be able to order your product again from a sincere customer.
