FootMates Cheer 2 (Infant/Toddler)
Our favorite shoes growing up, and my son loves wearing them too. I like that it is made in wide size, even though my child's foot isn't wide, it makes it more confortable to wear right out of the box. Sad that we're on the last size they make this year.
These are REALLY well-made. When I initially pulled them out of the packaging they looked way too big. But when my daughter tried them on, they fit her perfectly. Very true to size even though they don't look it at first. She loves these shoes.

These are the cutest shoes ever! I ordered them a half size smaller based on other recommendations and the fit was perfect. My son wore them to a wedding and they were perfect.
These are great shoes. They run a little big. My two year old typically wears a size 8 in Stride Rite and Adidas, and these were a touch big. I just used thicker socks. They scuff pretty easily, but not more than you could expect. I would buy another pair.
I found this shoe to be a 1/2 size smaller so I ordered a 1/2 size larger. That was a perfect fit and the width is a perfect fit for my son who has wide feet. The soles are perfect to keep him from sliding. I found the shoe strings to be a little too long, but overall the shoe is excellent!

Bought these shoes for my granddaughter. They are absolutely beautiful on her. Very well constructed and worth the extra money. The length does run about a 1/2 size larger, but this site recommended to order a 1/2 size smaller so the fit was perfect. The width was perfect too. She takes a wide and these shoes run true to the width. Would definitely recommend and will buy again next fall. 
I bought these for my three year old who will start her first year of pre-k. We loved them. Very soft and comfy. They do run big so you may want to order a size down. My daughter wear a size 10, I bought her the 9.5 and they fit perfect. They are the cutest shoes, can't wait to see her in her complete school uniform.
