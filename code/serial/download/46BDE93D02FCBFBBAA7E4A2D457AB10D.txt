New Balance MW928
I was hoping that this was just an updated version of the NB MW927, but it is a completely different model with a completely different fit.  NB shoes used to be ones that the same size and width would fit from model to model, but no more!
4th pair. Great shoe for comfort. I love the very wide size, and the support I get. I am a letter carrier and on my feet all day and at the end if the day with these shoes my feet are not tired at all. I have diabetes and found that with the 928's my feet have all the room to make them not squeezed together. Also the inside has no seam so it feels like I don't have a shoe on at all at times.
