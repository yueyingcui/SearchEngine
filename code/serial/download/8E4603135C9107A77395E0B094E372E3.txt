Shimano SHWM82
My husband has used a Shimano cycling shoe for spin class for about a year now, and he liked them so much he got me this pair for Christmas. I wear a 8.5 usually, and the size was spot on. My husband did put the cleats on for me (sold separately, he got them at a local bike shop), and though they are adjustable I wore them right away to class and had no issues. Straight out of the box they are really comfortable. When I wear tennis shoes to spin class I would sometimes have problems with arch pain and tingly toes. I had no issues like that with these, and they really enhanced the workout. My hamstrings and butt were sore, and I've been going to this class consistently for a year and a half prior to getting the shoes. I can't comment on their performance on a "real" bike as I haven't bought the pedals yet, but for spin class they are really great!
