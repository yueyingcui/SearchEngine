Native Shoes Jericho 
A good shoe for casual wear, but it ran almost two sizes small (I normally wear a men's 11 and had to order these in a 13 to get my feet into them) and are very narrow. Once you get size issues sorted out, however, they're perfectly comfortable and seem to hold up well to daily wear.
