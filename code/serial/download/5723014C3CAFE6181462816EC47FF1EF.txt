inov-8 Bare-X™ 200
I ordered a size 9. I now see what the other reviews are about with the plastic at the front by the big toe. There is a clear plastic piece that does not bend properly with the shoe. Besides feeling weird, it also makes the shoe look odd. I would have kept them if it weren't for that.
These are really comfortable. The one thing is that they do not have support, and I have flat feet. They run a bit small. I wear an 8, but in sneakers I have had to buy 9. These were size 8½ and I should have gotten half a size larger. Lately it seems like all sneakers run small!
