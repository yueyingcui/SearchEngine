Saucony Grid Shay XC3 (Spike)
I have to start with I couldn't disagree more with the previous review from 08/02/12. I think these are great spikes. They are true to size; I wear an 8 in a training shoe and the same for these spikes. I do not know of any racing flat or spike to have a great deal of arch/instep support hence a racing shoe. They are light and fit great. I have raced in them and highly recommend them to anyone.
