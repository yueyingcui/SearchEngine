New Balance WX997
Like the shoes...have a hard time finding my size...who knew 8 1/2 W was odd? New Balance never fails!
I use these shoes for fitness walking, mostly. They're very comfortable, true to size, and look good too!
I have made a serious effort in the gym for over a year now, primarily weight training and plyometrics with some use of the cardio machines. I have been using the WX997s for about 3 weeks now, and I have really enjoyed them! They took less than a week to break in, and they are true to size. It is a more narrow shoe than I am used to (I had Pumas before these), but I find the extra snug-ness helps when doing plyos. I saw these shoes in Muscle & Fitness Hers magazine and instantly loved the style & shape of these shoes. These were a great purchase!
