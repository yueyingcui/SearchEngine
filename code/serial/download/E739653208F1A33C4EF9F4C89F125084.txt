Pearl Izumi SyncroFuelâ„¢ Road II
I love this shoes! This is my second pair of the Syncrofuel Road II. I can run again without having any issues. I did replace the insole with a Superfeet insole. I had given up on finding a comfortable running shoe. They do run small so order 1/2 a size bigger. I wear a D width in New Balance and this shoes are wide enough for me. I have tried other Pearl Izumi but this model I the best so far.
I love these running shoes. I tried almost every shoe out there because of my knee pain, these are the ones that solve that problem, I could run finally without pain. I had the SyncroFuel I, and then I got these to start running again after baby, and they didn't disappoint, no need to break in. They do run small in PI, had to go a half size up. So happy I found them.(Oh, and I am a normal pronator or neutral).
