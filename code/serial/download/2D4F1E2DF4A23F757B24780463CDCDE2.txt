New Balance M780
Great running shoe - 
The green color doesn't go with any of my workout clothes, but who cares. The shoes feel great to run in and that's what counts. I recommend buying them a half size larger, cause mine are snug.

Best bang for the buck - 
I run trails in the northeast with mud,streams, rocks and with the tread on the 780's--I'm not doing any slipping. Also the mesh allows my feet to breath and dry out during the run. I have a pair of 905's too, but right now I am nursing a real good stinger on my right arch from a rock I landed on with the 905's. Wouldn't have happened with these. The white looks like your wearing spatts. I like these so much I am buying my second pair that I will need by next year. I have been to a dozen sites until I found my size here. They felt narrow at first, but after a few miles and mud they stretched right out. I usually take a 2E but I go with the D.905's are good for dry trails with little or no rocks.

NB trail shoe - 
The shoe fits true to size with roomy space for toe. Not as cushioned as the NB 806t and the lugged sole is not as prominent. Overall a good choice.
VERY NICE! Love these Shoes. NO ONE HAS THESE - 
I love these shoes. There is a sheen look to the green when it is placed in the sun. I had to go up in width size because it was narrow at the toes.
I only wear New Balance - 
New Balance are by far the best sneakers for people with wide feet. I wear both a large AND a wide size, so have had trouble finding a comfortable shoe. New Balance is the only brand I wear now because the fit and comfort as well as wide size range are superior. These shoes were no exception. I needed a comfortable wide shoe for post-foot surgery, and these shoes did not disappoint. I will continue to wear only New Balance.
