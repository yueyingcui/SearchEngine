Vans Kids Classic Slip-On (Infant/Toddler)
I bought these for my 20 month old granddaughter to wear.  They are so cute on!  My daughter said she is going to use them for my baby grandson when he gets in that size.
Been buying Vans for my now almost 4yr old since he was an infant, and the sizing has changed recently-they say as much with a additional hang tag announcing 'new fit... and they have been at least a half a size bigger than all his other shoes of the same size right now. Outside of the inaccurate size issue, Vans are great toddler shoes (easy to put on, yet stay on, light and flexible enough for early walker) and of course. The checkerboard's are simply a hot shoe.
These shoes are great for a toddler - daughter loves that there are no straps or buckles or 'tongue' to mess with and they look cool. However, the size is off - she is normally a size 9 but wears an 8 in these.
These shoes are great! They fit true to size and are long lasting and they are super cute!
I did not find this shoe to run large as reported. My son wears between a 10-10 1/2 so I ordered a 9 at the direction of other reviewers who said these run a size or more too big. He could not even get the 9 on this foot. But he loves them. Can't wait to get the right size so he can wear them. Looks like they are well made. Nice cushy insole too.
These shoes are very cute however they run super big! My son currently wears an 8 in Jordans so I bought 8 1/2 for growing space and they fit like a size 10!
