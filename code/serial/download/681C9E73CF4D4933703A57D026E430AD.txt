Nike Lunarglide+ 4
Got these to replace my running shoes. Typically Nike's run small on me because I have a wider foot, so I sized up a half size and although they were a little long for my foot they fit comfortably. I had developed plantar fasciitis and my foot would really kill the day after a work-out. After switching out to my new shoes my foot pain improved. Love the color (it's bright!) and the look of the shoe. Only giving it a 4 star because I wish they would offer a wide version.
Have always worn the Asics 2170 for running. I bought these to cross train and had to run in them .... They were great! It was like running on clouds! I have foot issues, plantar etc. And I am very choosy about shoes. I have since run in them exclusively and feel great. I wear a size 11 in regular shoes and a 12 in the Nike.
These shoes look great and have nice arch support but they felt too small. I'm usually a 9.5 but I order running shoes in a size 10 from Nike...always. But this pair felt a full size too small. I'm going to return them.
These shoes felt great the moment I put them on. They held my feet securely, stable with lateral movements, great cushioning. But my toes were all the way at the top, so I am exchanging them for the next size up. I am hoping that that solves the problem, because I really liked everything else about these shoes.
It's got great support and so comfortable, they look awesome and fit perfectly, true to size. I'd buy them again
