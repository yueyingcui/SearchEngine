Puma Kids Voltaic 3 Jr (Toddler/Youth)
Pretty sweet shoes! My son loves them. I have noticed however that the size I need in Puma tennis shoes for my boys are consistently a half size larger than the size I need in Nike shoes for the boys. 
This shoe is awesome and seems to be really good quality, which is very important in a child's shoe! The laces are a bit short, but not a problem since the loops don't hang low once tied, but makes tying a little more difficult for little hands just learning to tie. This shoe does run small. My son normally wears a 13 but we needed to order a 1, so make sure you order a size larger. We love these shoes!
This is a very cool, well-made shoe that my eight-year-old loved. The Pumas do seem to be a little smaller than other brands, so consider a half-size larger.
These shoes are a beautiful color, very comfortable and have a nice wide toe box.  They run true to size and wear well.  
My daughter has a long, narrow foot and these fit her well. They fit in both the toe box and the heel, so no blisters. I like the grey color because they hide the dirt much better than white. Puma's tend to run short so I ordered a half size up.
