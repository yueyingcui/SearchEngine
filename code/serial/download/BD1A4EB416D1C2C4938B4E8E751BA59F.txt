Nike Scramble TR
I'm a big guy with size 14 EEE sized shoes and obviously my choices in fashionable footwear are nothing short of limited. I liked these sneaks from the start and took a chance on the 2W width offered in this black style. When they arrived, I loosened up the laces a bit as I always do before trying on shoes and...finally! Great looking shoes that perform well and fit!
