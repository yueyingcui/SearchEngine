Pretty cool shoe; if you plan on wearing these with out no show socks, I would suggest ordering them in your normal size.  They are a little snug, but, I wanted them to fit like a sock.
Definitely order in at least a half size larger than your normal shoe size (I ordered mine a full size up and they fit perfectly). Very excellent and lightweight shoe. One thing I didn't consider was that it would be awkward wearing socks with these because of the split toe. If you plan on wearing socks with these, you might want to consider buying split toe socks or individual toe socks.
I had been looking for a good water cross-over shoe. Something to wear around the water - fishing, boating, etc. - but not necessarily an "in the water" shoe. The Maliko fits this bill perfectly. They're great on wet surfaces and are tough enough to wear on rock and concrete. They're also pretty lightweight and breathable. (Plus they look much cooler than Croc or other molded foam shoes.) For people concerned about the split-toe design, it feels like flip-flop. One thing to keep in mind - I found that these run a good full size smaller than I normally wear.
