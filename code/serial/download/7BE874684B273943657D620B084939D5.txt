New Balance WW812
I have been buying NB 800 Series for 20 years, based on a recommendation of a podiatrist; always the same size.  As the series advanced up to NB811 the style and design remained the same. I ordered these with confidence knowing that the latest pair would be perfect.  As it turns out, the 812 is a drastically different design and fit than it's predecessors. It has a new puffy heel wrap that does not hold my foot in place. It feels about an inch too long in the toe.  I am sadly disappointed as I will now have to find a new sneaker after all these years.  Based on reviews I have read, I am going to try NB927 or 928. 
Very happy to find this shoe in my hard to find size. Ordered this and another shoe. They arrived next day. Send back 2nd shoe because I ordered it a size down and was too short. Excellent service!
This is a great shoe. I love the way it hugs your heel. I have a lot of problems with slipping heels, so this was a welcome change. One thing - it runs wide and long! I had to order a 1/2 size smaller than usual.
I just bought these shoes before leaving for Paris where we wanted at least 3-4 miles a day. They were great...my feet and ankles still swelled but they didn't hurt and I didn't get any blisters (I also wear Thorlo walking socks!) This is the third pair of these shoes I've bought over the last 10 years at least...adapting to the new models as they discontinue the old. I highly recommend them. And yes, they do run small and narrow, so I bought a size 8 in medium width, when I usually wear a 7 1/2 narrow.
I have been using NB ww811 and that fits my small (5.5) size, flat, wide toe feet the best. WW812 seems to be a little (.5cm) longer than the WW811 and my heels are popping out. But I will find some pads at my heels and use the shoes since these are still the best for me.
