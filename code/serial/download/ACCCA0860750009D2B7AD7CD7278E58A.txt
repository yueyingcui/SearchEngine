Tsukihoshi Kids Wheel( Toddler/Youth)
My son has always worn Tsukihoshi's. This one runs ever bigger than their customary half size larger. I need to return them for a half size smaller.
These are great. My 6 year old loves them and just the perfect weight/colors for spring. I had to order one full size below (ordered a 12 and he is just fitting in a 13). I had ordered a 13 in this brand on another style, and they were way too big. I'm putting those away for next year, so ordered these for this summer. Super comfy! Easy to put on. Good traction. Couldn't be happier.
