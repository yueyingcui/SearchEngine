Nike Action Zoom Oncore 2
I found this shoe to be very comfortable. True size and the colors are exactly as shown in the pictures, no surprises there.
This is not a shoe for longboarders or those who plan to footbrake. These lasted me two months before the airsole blew. The oncore 1 had the cushion in a better place. Those shoes lasted and were great for distance longboarding because the airsole is a sweet cushion. I would stay away from these if you are looking to footbrake at any significant level. I will bet that they are great for the vertical stuff. Also, they take a while to break in, so go half a size bigger.
