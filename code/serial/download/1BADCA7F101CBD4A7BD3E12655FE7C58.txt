Shimano SH-WR31L
I had heard and seen tons of great reviews for the Shimano brand and I loved the look of these so I purchased them. I got a half size bigger than what I usually wear for room for wearing socks. They fit perfectly and are super comfortable! 
This shoe is great - I ordered it for indoor cycling, it's sturdy, true to size, and very comfortable.  Highly recommend.
These are great for spinning classes.  I'm not qualified to suggest them for outside riding because I won't wear them for that.  Probably could though.  True to size, easy to get on and off too.
