Montrail Rogue Fly
Very comfortable because there aren't any seams, but seems to run small. I had to order a 1/2 size larger.
I was surprisingly dissatisfied by this shoe, probably because I bought it under the presumption that it would fit similarly as my Mountain Masochists of the same size and width. However, it turns out that these Rogue Flys are rather tight around the foot, to the point where the lace length was insufficient to tie up (not that I needed to because of their tightness). Also, the toe box felt uncomfortably closed. At least the heel support was fair, but there's almost no support for the forefoot. Overall, a disappointment for Montrail.
