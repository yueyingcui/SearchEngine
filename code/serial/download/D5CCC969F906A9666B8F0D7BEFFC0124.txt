etnies Kids RVM Vulc (Toddler/Youth)
This style of Etnies fits my son's slightly wide and high foot nicely. He is very picky when it comes to how his shoes fit. He does not like a snug fit. I tried them on since we are the same size now and they are pretty comfy. Personally I prefer more arch support, but that doesn't seem to bother my 9 year old. Etnies hold up great.
