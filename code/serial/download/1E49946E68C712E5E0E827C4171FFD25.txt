New Balance MW512
Horrible! I used to wear the New Balance MX -622AB, size 10.5 4E. Since NB decided to stop making them, I looked for an alternative. I tried the MW-512. It just arrived, and it barely fit me, and the 4-E? No way is this shoe a 4-E. Just horrible!
These felt smaller than any other athletic/walking shoe I have ever worn of the same size. Recommend ordering a 1/2 size larger than expected.
I used to wear the 631, the similar non-slip shoe that NB no longer makes. Since I was forced to now buy this shoe, I obediently forked over my hard-earned money having some trust in the New Balance brand, due to the fact that I have been impressed with about 4 other styles of NB sneakers. I noticed the tight fit right away, my right foot is bigger than my left by a few millimeters, so when that shoe is tight, I know the size is off. I like EE width to give room for my toes to spread out a little, the width is snug with this shoe, unlike other NB EE sneakers I have owned. The sole is not as soft or as flexible as the 631, and it seems like they have really cut corners to save on materials without lowering the price, for instance there is now a "dent" where the sole does not contact the ground (ironically there are still non-slip tread inside this dent) - the 631 had a flat sole and an extended heel which had much more surface area in contact with the ground, which seems safer to me than this new design. Additionally, I had to supplement the inadequate thin foam insert that comes standard, with Dr. Scholls gel. Finally, the design is unsightly, the shape and profile of the shoe are unappealing and make me feel like a dork when I wear them. I hate these shoes, and really don't know what other choice there is - I guess I can go to Sears and get their ugly non-slip cheap shoes for crews, because what's the difference anymore?
