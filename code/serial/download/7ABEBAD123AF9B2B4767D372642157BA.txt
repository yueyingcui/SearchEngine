New Balance W790v2
I like these shoes. They are my 4th pair. I do Zumba, treadmill, and walk, and do the job. I like them for Zumba because I am able to twist. Correct to size.
These shoes put a spring in my step. They are very comfortable and look really nice too. I wear a size 11 shoe and ordered an 11 first, but they were too small. I sent them back and got the next size up (12) without issue. These fit fine and I'm very happy with them.
