Nike Kids Free Run 3 (Youth)
These shoes are stylish and comfortable. After not having worn good quality running shoes in a long time, my feet felt really well supported for the first time in a while. They definitely are good for my arches and holds the foot snuggly. Might be a bit tighter than needed, however, my feet are a bit wide. Maybe order a size up if you have wider feet also. I wear a size 6.5 in women's but bought the youth size that corresponds and it was great to spend a little less money for a shoe that still fits great.
My son likes these shoes but the sizes are inconsistent. Overall they run smaller than listed.
Very stylish!!! Kind of narrow so we decided to go with a larger size. Very comfortable too. Highly recommended!!!
I ordered these for my son at the same time I ordered the Lunarglide 3 for my daughter.  My son's shoes were marked a 6 and my daughters were a 5 but they were exactly the same size.  I'd say these shoes although very cool and light run at least a full size smaller than you'd think.
