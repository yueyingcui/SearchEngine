Lowa Renegade II GTXÂ® Lo WS
These are brilliant. They fit and are perfect for hiking.  It's hard finding narrow sizes and I was thrilled that you had them in my size.
This is a very nice hiking shoe and I wish it fit me. The toe box is generous and it laces up well for a narrow foot. However, despite the narrow size, the heel is too wide and slips up and down on my foot. Given the cost, I don't want to have to adjust the size by adding non-slip pads. I will continue to search for something to fit my AA size foot.
These were a little stiff for me so I ordered Merrell instead. Very nice looking and sturdy hiking shoe.  True to size.
