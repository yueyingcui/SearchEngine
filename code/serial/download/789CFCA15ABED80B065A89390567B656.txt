K-Swiss Grancourtâ„¢ II W
I love this shoe!  I wear a size 11 and K-Swiss makes a great tennis shoe for hard and clay courts.  Very comfortable.
These are great, comfortable, practical tennis shoes, but unfortunately they run a full size too big! I usually wear a size 8 in running shoes/sneakers and these shoes were very large and wide.
After trying on tons of wide tennis shoes, that weren't quite wide enough, these were certainly wide enough for me. They are very comfortable, but size-wise, I wonder if I would have been better off with the 9.5 wide, since there is a bit of extra room. The only choice was medium or EE, so it would be nice if they came in regular wide, or E.
