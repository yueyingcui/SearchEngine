Mizuno Wave® Creation™ 13
I'm a 300-lb, 30% body fat first-time 5k runner who was destroying his legs by running in low-price cross trainers. I bought these after researching them here, and elsewhere on the Internet, where the consensus was that these were excellent shoes for fat guys like me to run in. I can report that the Internet is correct about these shoes. They offer excellent support and shock absorption; if anything, it's a little harder to control my pace in them because they make running that much easier. Also, reports about the red shoes leaching onto socks made me buy the gold ones. Unfortunately, the gold logo on the insole will leech as well and ruin your socks. FYI; you might want to cover it, or just accept that your socks are going to be destroyed by these shoes. Better them than my knees, I figure. Final note: Because I have a wide foot and these only come in a medium, I ordered a half-size larger than my foot, and it was a good choice. I probably could have gotten away with ordering the same size, but the extra length did convert to extra width, thanks to the extensive lacing on this shoe.
