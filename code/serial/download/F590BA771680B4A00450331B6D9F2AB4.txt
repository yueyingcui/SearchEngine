Keen Portsmouth
This Keen was one of only two pairs that I could keep out of 6 pairs I tried on.  This one is stiff and about a half size big, but fits well.  The others all had sizing issues even though they were the same model I ordered last year in the same size.
My husband loves these shoes. They are true to size in length and they run wide; which is exactly what he needed. He has a tender spot on his foot which has not bothered him since he got this shoe.
I have worn out 3 pair of these shoes and I like them so much I keep buying a replacement pair. Last time I ordered the same size (11) they were much narrower than before and they did not fit. It appears that the size varies somwhat from one pair to another.
