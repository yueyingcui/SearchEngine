Diadora Maracana RTX 12
Love this boot. Nice soft leather, and great touch. Extremely comfortable, and fits my wide foot very comfortably. Very true to size. Removable insole is a good feature too. 
I just started training outdoors for the season and so far loving these cleats. Fit is snug in the heel and wide in the toes. These have removable insoles if you have your own. I’ve always had problems finding soccer shoes that fit well because of different size feet and wide toes. These are very light, comfortable and provide a good feel for the ball. Also I haven’t had the usual pain making the transition to a new pair of cleats. I usually wear a 9 but sometimes fit a 9.5; with these the 9 was a bit short in the length.

I really liked these cleats. They are soft, well-made and reasonably priced for the quality. However, be careful on the sizing. I wear an 8.5 (occasionally 9 in Nike running shoes) in woman's shoes and based on some reviews I sized down 1/2 size and got a 7 Mens. It was too small. While I am sure the kangaroo leather will stretch, the length will not. My toes were already touching the front of the sneaker. I found the width normal. I ended up returning and buying the woman's version Maracana MD PU in size 9 which was a perfect fit for me.
I have the indoor version of these shoes and would say the fit is comparable. The kangaroo leather stretches to fit. I have wide feet, 3E, and find these cleats to be plenty wide though they may run a little long in the size.
These cleats made a noticeable difference in my play. They are light so they seem to be very good for strikers, but as a defender I have a better control over the ball and more success getting the ball out of the danger zone. My feet are wide so I need to get 9.5 for my 9 foot size.
