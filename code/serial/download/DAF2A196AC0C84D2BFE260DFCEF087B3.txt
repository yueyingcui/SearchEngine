Sperry Kids Halyard (Toddler)
This shoe runs big. I used the size charts provided on the product page to confirm my son's size and ordered accordingly. The shoes were so big my son walked right out of them. Because we needed the shoes immediately, I went to a local store and bought them a full size smaller. Aside from the sizing problem, the shoes are cute and appear well-made.
