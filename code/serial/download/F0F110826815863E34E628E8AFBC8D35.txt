Converse Work Backstop
After about a month of wearing these shoes, let me just bend over and inspect these bad boys, yup, all the seams are holding steady, the creases aren't breaking apart, all the reflective grey parts are still reflective at a distance. The sole is still fully attached, tongue is still holding fine, laces aren't fraying. Fit is comfortable, even for long periods of standing. Runs about 0.5 to 1 size big. The wide (which is what I wear) fits even the widest foot (again, my foot). I typically wear all my shoes half a size big anyway, so these work great. 4 star ratings are because I've worn more comfortable shoes before, but hey, these are "steel toed" work shoes from Converse, not Red Wing or Gucci.
As others have stated, these run a 1/2 size to big minimum.  I typically wear 8.5 and the size 8 fits with tons of room.  They are comfortable and stylish, but it is pretty noticeable they have a safety toe cap.  I would recommend them as a nice option if you are required to wear safety shoes.
I have been wearing these shoes for about a month now. I find that this shoe is very comfortable, not something you expect from a shoe with a composite toe. It came with an EVA sole that is more for stability, but you can insert an after market sole if you need more arch support. I am a size 11W and took the advice of other reviews and purchased a size 10 1/2 W. The shoe fits perfect even with a thicker aftermarket sole.
