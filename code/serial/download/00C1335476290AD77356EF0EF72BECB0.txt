New Balance MR993
I bought these at my husband's request. Then, I bought another pair. He thinks these are the most comfy athletic shoes that he has ever worn. They last a long time -- a year or more, even though he wears them almost every day. We love that they are still made in the US -- the sizes are more generous (he has wide feet), and the materials of better quality than those made offshore.
I purchased this shoe for walking rather than for running. It is very comfortable. I had returned another brand because of the fit. This shoe size seems true and fits well. And it is made in the U.S.A.
I live in NYC and walk all day. I eventually developed plantar fasciitis and had to get shoes with good support-these are the only shoes that have helped my injury. Very comfortable, highly recommend! They also come in various sizes and widths- true to size!
