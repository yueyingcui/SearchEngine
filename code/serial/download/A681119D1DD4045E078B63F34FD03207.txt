Macbeth Langley
These were my first Macbeths and wow are they lovely. The only bad thing about them is that they're a real pain to break in. It was super tight on the tops of my feet and kind of squeezed them. After wearing them for a week or two they feel much better. I would recommend sizing up at least half a size. But overall a beautiful shoe! Langley is definitely my favorite style.
I really wanted to like these shoes, as it's very difficult to find comfortable shoes that look good and aren't made of leather. I have a "high instep" which means my feet are fairly meaty on top and I could barely even fit my feet in these shoes. Also, although I liked the way they look, they had kind of a cheapish feel to them. I would definitely recommend ordering a half size larger than you usually wear. As for me, it's back to the drawing board.
