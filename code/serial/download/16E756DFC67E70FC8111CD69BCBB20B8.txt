K-Swiss The Classicâ„¢ 
In my size (women's 7), these look stumpy.  Like old people shoes.  Not flattering.
The K-Swiss Classic was true to size and fit well on first wearing. The inside of the sneaker isn't well-padded and the leather is pretty unforgiving, so you'll need to break them in gradually if you're prone to heal blisters.
I've been wearing these since they first came out. Love them. Look great on..even if you wear a large size like I do. They don't look like every other sneaker out there, which I like. Nice clean lines, not bulky or clunky. Can't go wrong here.
