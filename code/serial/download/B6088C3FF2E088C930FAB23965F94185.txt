Propet Life Walker Strap
Very comfortable and well made. Beware, however, that they run about a half a size too big and an extra letter wide. 
These are the closest sneakers I've found to my Rockports with the two Velcro straps which are no longer manufactured.  I ordered the same size and they fit fine.
I got this shoe for my husband, size 15 ww. True to size and width... at least for the right foot. He's an amputee so cannot comment on the left shoe. He's very happy with the shoe. Traction and fit.
Wonderful product and customer service was fantastic.  Had to return first pair, ordered the wrong size, and it was an enjoyable experience.  No problems at all.
