Vans Kids Classic Slip-On Core (Toddler/Youth)
Love the vintage style, but note that they run a full size or size and a half larger than other brands.  
My 10 yo daughter loves her Vans! But the size chart showing her to wear a youth 4; it was way too big, even the 3.5 was a bit big, so we kept the size 3.5/ These are so well made - she plays outside a lot(we live on the edge of town)and she plays hard, yet they hold up very well! Just don't let the dog get a hold of them !
This is the 2nd pair of Vans for this child.  Because he wears them so much, they seem to wear out that much more quickly.  The rubber between the sole and the canvas seems to be the 1st to go.  I've found that, depending upon the child, the shoes run about 1/2 size too big to almost true.  The nice part about Vans for kids is that they are able to express their personality/likes in an inexpensive, inoffensive manner; neon green check and flames live at my house, too.
