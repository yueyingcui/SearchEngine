Converse Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox
I love my Chuck Taylors! Retro, cute and comfy. Do order a full size smaller than your normal athletic shoe size (I wear an 8 but needed a 7 in these). There's little arch support, but the sole is thick and cushiony and I can wear them for hours in comfort, even with my high arches.
Converse are the best! I own Chucks in navy, black, maroon, gray, white, orange, high top black, high top white and I own Jack Purcells in black and white. And my newest pair, is off white and there my favorite. I have to say Converse is the best brand of all time and I wish I could own every color! There great for hanging out with friends, or anything you could think of! However, I'm a size 10 or 10.5 in Nikes but with Converse I'm a size 8, but they might fit different for someone else. So I suggest going down at least 1 size. Chuck Taylors are my second most comfortable shoes, next to my Jacks. But it just goes to show that whether you get Chuck Taylors, or Jack Purcells, all Converses are comfortable! When you get your first pair of Converse, you will want to get every other color and style that exists! You won't regret this purchase! Get Converse!
Reliable and fast as always. Converse sizing can be screwy sometimes since they are unisex but sized differently.
These converse are great! I think they look a lot cooler than the bright white ones and are overall a great purchase. Make sure to buy them a half size smaller than your shoe size.
I have sort of wide feet, so my foot is hard to fit, and these fit perfectly and true to size. They are really comfortable too!  A true classic, and at a great price with super fast shipping!
This shoe matches with almost anything. Not for running but comfortable for weight lifting, I don't care for arch support, but this shoe did come a half size larger but it's been a couple months and I don't have any complaints. Next time I will order a half size down to get a perfect fit. Ordered size 9.5.
