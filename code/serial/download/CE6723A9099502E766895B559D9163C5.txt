La Sportiva Crossover GTX
I can't say enough about these and their low-cut versions, 'cept that I hope La Sportiva never stops making them. Having been into mountaineering and orienteering for 45 years, few shoes have ever delivered the way these do. On the trail and pavement, I put in a lot of miles every week and these hold up better than almost anything I've ever worn. They are true to size, accommodate my slightly wider feet, but wouldn't be too much for a narrower foot. I'm sure I get well over 500 miles per pair, after which I retire them for workout, work and banging around purposes. LS, don't change a thing and PLEASE keep making them.
Outstanding shoe for running in snow or wet. It's sort of bizarre that no one came up with this design earlier. I've used it for playing other sports and found there's enough lateral support as well. Bizarre sizing though - very small. Probably best to order two sizes larger than you might normally.
