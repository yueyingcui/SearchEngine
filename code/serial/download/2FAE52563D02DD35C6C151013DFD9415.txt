Avia A339M
I have been a true size 9 since high school. Have had no problem with store bought shoes and other internet orders. This shoe was shorter, perhaps an 8 and very narrow, tight and created sore spots on the various 'high' spots on my feet - Big toe - little toe and left red marks/sores on my feet. I thought that perhaps there was a breaking in time needed, but after 3-4 weeks the issues still remain and since they are worn now, I guess I'm stuck with them.
I have horribly flat and wide feet. After tearing off the arch supports my size 13 double wides are perfect and very comfortable.
These are comfortable shoes, but the width is a little narrower than expected for the 4E size that I purchased.
These shoes are really comfortable for walking. Great arch support as well. I ordered a half size larger as some reviewers suggested for Avia shoes. They were right on. You cannot beat these for comfort, support and inexpensive to own.
Try these and you won't regret it!
