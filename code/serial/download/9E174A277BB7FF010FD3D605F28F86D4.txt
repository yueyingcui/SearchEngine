Timberland PRO TiTANÂ® Women's Oxford
I've only had my shoes for about a week, but I love them! (I have a women's size 8D.) I'm a high school student, which doesn't seem like it would require work boots, but I carry 25-30lbs of textbooks and binders up and down several flights of steep, worn smooth stairs to class every day, and spend about two hours of a 7 hour school day on my feet. I have a lot of pain from "ligamentous laxity," or loose ligaments, in my hips, knees and feet from this activity, but the last week it's been almost erased. The cushiony arch supports in these shoes allow my feet to flex and still support the extra weight of my bag, pain-free. I usually buy skate-style shoes, which almost never have arch supports but are heavily cushioned, and wear them out in about eight months or so. I think that these boots will last much longer than that (I chose these for their durability), and the insole doesn't seem to have compressed at all. The toe box is wide and tall enough for my wide feet without being clown shoes, the lacing doesn't press on the top of my foot like most structured shoes do, and the low top allows me to run and jog when necessary. They felt broken-in and wearable right out of the box! My only concern is that Timberland doesn't seem to sell replacement insoles.
I purchased these shoes seven months ago. I am a machinist and as a women with larger feet I have a had a hack of a time finding safety toed shoes. I own size 11. They are quite roomy, almost big. The toe box is generously proportioned so there is no friction with the safety toe. I like these so much better than the last pair of steel toed shoes I bought; not only are they lighter and more comfortable but the composite doesn't cool off like steel does. Definitely a plus for me. I wear these shoes upwards of 10 hours a day, 5+ days a week. After seven months of having things dropped and spilt on them they aren't the prettiest but they are just as comfortable as day one.
