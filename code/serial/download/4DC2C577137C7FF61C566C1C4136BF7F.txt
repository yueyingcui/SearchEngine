Heelys Sparkler (Toddler/Youth)
Best customer service. When I had a question, the online instant chat worked easily. I did order too big a size at first and the return couldn't have been easier as well (and I don't do a lot of online shopping stuff). This shoe fits true to size. Heely's used to run small (several years ago) but not any longer. Love the shoes, we've had them before.
Bought these for my granddaughter. She absolutely loves them. I did order up a size.
My six year old loves her new shoes. She got them for Christmas and I think she has only had them off her feet long enough to sleep, maybe. They are easy to put on by herself. I ordered a size bigger than she wears and they are just a little too big, which makes no difference. I am very glad I ordered bigger. She took only a few hours of practice to get the hang of it and now she's all over the house, steering her way around. I totally recommend the double wheel version for beginners and first time Heely owners. We are very happy with our purchase!
