Saucony ProGridâ„¢ Kinvara 3
I was a big fan of the Kinvara 1, but the 2 just seemed a little too snug in the toe box area. So I was nervous that the 3 would be also be like this, but I was so happy to find that it's much improved. I still bought the same size as the 1 and the 2, but it just fits so much better. There's room for my toes to move but it's not sloppy at all. Big fan of the update!
Great running shoe. Most reviews for the Kinvara's say to order 1 full size up. I didn't find that. With my running shoes, I normally order 1/2 size up from my everyday shoe and that works perfectly for me with this shoe. Love it & the color too!
I absolutely love these shoes. They are lightweight, look good, and feel great. I first ordered them a size up becuase I have a slightly wide forefoot and read the three reviews that recommended going up even a size and a half. I went up a full size but they were way too long. When I reordered, I did not know if I should go up half a size. I ended up ordering what I always wear and they fit perfectly; just like all my other Saucony shoes have, plus Avia, Reebok, and Asics, so I do not think the sizing is off at all.
Changes since the Kinvara 2: the lacing system is different and the 3 has a softer feel to the insole, the toe box feels a bit higher but not wider on me. The outer bands protect the mesh exterior better than the Kinvara 2, as the thin mesh tends to get caught and tear with wear, I think the new bands will help solve that. I did prefer the old lacing method. I do not like the colored laces prefer the white ones. I wear a street size 7 and have to go up a full size and 1/2 with this shoe, which is the same as the Kinvara 2 I own.
