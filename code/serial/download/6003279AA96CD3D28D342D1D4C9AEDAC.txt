Brooks Dyad 7
So far I have only worn them twice in step class. They are a bit heavy, but they provide good cushioning, however both times that I have worn them, the front of my foot area got that tingly, falling asleep feeling. I bought wide and half a size up. They are plenty wide. The arch support seems a bit higher than I like, which is why I think my foot fell asleep. I have high arches and need, some cushioning in the middle. These may have too much. The color is striking.
