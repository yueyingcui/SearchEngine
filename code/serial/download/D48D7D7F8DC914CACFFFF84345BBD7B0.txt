Ryka Trail Exodus 2
About a half size too small.  I am a 6.5 and my toes touched the end of the shoe.  Comfortable otherwise, I'll be exchanging for the next size up.
Very attractive shoe. Extremely comfortable. I wear size 8, but like my shoes a little large, so got an 8 1/2. I would get this style (another color) again I like it so well.
I love these shoes, I had to get a 1/2 size bigger but now that I have the correct size they are very comfortable.
I needed a shoe for heavy walking and light running, as well as general workouts. It did take me an hour or so to get used to the insole (several people mentioned that in their reviews, so I was expecting it); other than that, the shoe was fantastic. Excellent support, looks slick (I walked out of my office when first trying them on and one of the guys said, whoa! Cool). They feel really comfortable, and I wore them for a workout the first day without any break in. Do buy about 1/2 size up; I'm normally an 8 and ordered an 8 1/2 based on the reviews, which fits beautifully. Great shoe, would pay double the price for this fit and quality - and happy not to have to!
I would not recommend these shoes to anyone. They are extremely uncomfortable. My feet hurt when and after I wear them. They run small in size.
These shoes are cute, lightweight and comfortable. I was actually surprised at how cute they really are. They go with a lot since they have white and black. They are really the ideal shoes for doing everyday errands, etc. I did wear them on a three mile walk/hike and I did get a blister, but it may have been my socks. Overall you really cannot beat the price and look/feel. I think they run a little small, maybe order half a size up.
