adidas Golf Crossflex
If you are looking for a lightweight golf shoe with great traction, you've found your shoe. Order a half size bigger. I have tried other "sneaker" type golf shoes, I think this is the best overall. Great for hot weather. And the best of Adidas golf lightweight, non-spike shoes.
