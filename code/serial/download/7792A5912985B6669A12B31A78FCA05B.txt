Chrome Tobruk
Normally I wear 10½ or 11, depending on the shoes, so I ordered 10½. They felt way too loose especially considering they are slip-ons designed for cycling. Pulling a heel out while pushing a fixed gear at high speed would not be fun. So I sent them back for a size 10, no big deal. At first they were a bit tight but as they have broken in they have gotten more comfortable. They are OK as walking shoes but a little clunky due to the reinforced soles. From about the arch- back, the soles are literally solid. But that is not what these are made for. These things really come into their element when you jump on your bike. I have never felt more connected to flat pedals than with these shoes. The grip is incredible. I have had them about a month now and they are holding up well so far. I have already recommended these to friends.
This sounds crazy, but here it is. I love the look of these shoes - so I bought them in my normal size 11. They fit great. I wore them every day - but after 2 weeks they were too small (?!). So I bit the bullet and bought a size 11.5. They were great for 2 weeks - and now too small. These are the incredible shrinking shoes. And yes, I have lots of shoes - my feet are not getting bigger.
