ASICS GEL-Extreme33â„¢
I'm a woman who wears a men's size for length. I've previously had many pairs of Asics Gel Nimbus, because I need a neutral shoe. This model also seems quite neutral. I always wear custom orthotics so I can't comment on the arch support. I like the light weight of this shoe and also the black/white color choice: it looks a bit dressier than the usual "out-there" color combinations. It's an about-town shoe for me rather than a running or hiking shoe.
I ordered these shoes because I love Asics for running and needed new shoes for work (I stand on my feet for 8-12 hours a day). These were colorful and fun. They are also very comfortable and make standing not so hard! I definitely recommend them, and they run "slightly" small but fairly true to size.
I absolutely love this shoe, but I bought a 7.5 which is what I always wear, and they gave me terrible blisters on the back of both feet! I recommend going up a full size.
I love these shoes.  They are eye-catchers.  People always comment on these shoes.  I did buy them a 1/2 size larger.  The toe box is not as wide as some of my other shoes.  They are extremely comfortable with the gel insole. 
Incredibly comfortable and stylish.  They're right in the middle of a minimalist gym shoe and a regular gym shoe.  Depending on the brand, I'm usually a 7.5 and 8.  For these, I ordered an 8. and they just fit.    If I ordered an 8.5 I'd be happy with them.  So, my recommendation is go up a full size.
