Supra Skytop III
These have an amazing board feel, the heel shock absorbant really, good grip, comfortable. They need to be half a size bigger (I am a size 9Â½, I should have gone with a 10). I definitely felt my foot was squished (too narrow) but that is part of the breaking in part. Sometimes when your walking the strap scratches your Achilles tendon.
Nice shoe.  True to size.  Purchased upon request of my son.   He is tough on shoes but these seem to be wearing at the toes faster.
Extremely comfortable. Took some time to figure the best way to tie them. I wrapped the laces along the sides to meet and tie in the back below the little handle, then I cut the ends off. Looks nice & clean. I also have the black ones...love 'em, get compliments all the time. Definitely get a half size bigger than your usual.
Very comfortable and stylish. They do feel a little tight and definitely run a half size smaller. Other than that, they're a great shoe.
Great shoe. Fits a little tighter than what the size says. Be careful of staining tongue of shoe.
