etnies Jameson 2
Definitely a really sweet shoe! Probably my favorite, most comfortable and best fitting pair in a few year's worth of shoes. I should've gone a half size higher maybe, it's just the tiniest bit too small.
My son bought and loves these shoes!  He wears size 15 and his feet are more on the wider side. He was a lot and his feet don't hurt at the end of the day. Great purchase!
Very comfortable shoes, the insoles are good, and do provide a nice arch support. I have had many pairs by Etnies, and if anything this specific model runs just about 1/4 size smaller. So that was a perfect fit for me, as I'm usually between 10.5 and 11.0 and these fit perfect.
