Tsukihoshi Kids Retro (Toddler/Youth)
Very cute! Put them on my 2yr old immediately upon receipt and she loves them! wore them all day. :) Very well made shoe that provides great support for little feet and it's not stiff. Easy to put on and off. Tempted to buy another pair a couple of sizes bigger for future use. The only con...it makes my little one faster. ;)
A friend of mine bought these sneakers for my daughter. She loved them so much that she asked for the same exact pair when her feet went up a size.
I love this brand, shoes are comfortable, very light weight, and easy to clean! My daughter loves these, they are super cute! Order a 1/2 size smaller than you need, if you want them to fit with a little growing room.
This is a great everyday sneaker for my 2 year old daughter.  It's cute, it's easy to put on, even for her.  It seems comfortable and never left red marks or blisters on her feet.  As she has grown, I bought a larger size.  I wish they offered more color selections.
Okay, buy these! My daughter (7 years) has loved these sneakers for 3 years -- we just keep buying bigger sizes and occasionally different colors. She really doesn't want to wear any other shoe! My son (3 years) has a similar pair in more boyish colors and loves them too. They are well made, washable, look great and best of all are super comfortable.
Super cute! They are great and my daughter loves to wear them. We ordered a half size larger and they fit wonderfully. The only problem is they scuff up easily. My daughter plays in them and they are all scuffed on the front.
