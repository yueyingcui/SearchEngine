Frye Kira High Top
Very good looking shoe with quality leather. I ordered a half size up from my normal 6 1/2 and still the shoe feels small; tight across the toes. Also the string guide on the tongue of one shoe broke the 2nd time I wore them.
I've been super happy with these kicks so far. I bought them in lavender and I love the color. It took a little while to find the right size, because they are long and narrow. I'm usually a 7.5/8 and the 7 actually fit length wise but then the shoe was much too narrow. The 8 was too long so I ended up with the 7.5, which is still a bit long but fits well otherwise. Other than that, they're super comfy. The leather is soft and keeps my feet warm and they took only about a day to break in. I bought these because I wanted a good quality sneaker and I trust Frye. I have noticed that the rubber along the side in one small area is starting to come away from the leather but I'm hoping that won't happen to the rest of the shoe.
Had a chance to try these pups on at a local shoe store. They do run short in length, as the low top version of this shoe. I have several of Frye boots and they run very true to size bordering on a little roomy in length. However in this brands sandals and shoes a different story? Go, figure? Don't know why some are so different.
