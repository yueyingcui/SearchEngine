Keds Kids Graham (Infant/Toddler)
My son has a wide foot so I ordered a half size larger than he usually wears. They fit perfectly! I love Keds for little boys when you need something nicer than their everyday athletic shoes but not as dressy as church shoes.
We ordered in a Wide, which is perfect for my 2 year old. Super cute and easy enough to get on. He doesn't complain, so they must be comfy. I like them a lot. True to size.

Super cute, good quality, and inexpensive. They do run a bit narrow, but I am very pleased with this style and brand! I found it difficult to find this particular shoe in the correct size...seems that they are rather popular, and I can see why.
I'm so sad I have to return these they're super cute but they run small my son couldn't fit them and I ordered them a half size up!
Runs true to size. Good alternative (cheap and more comfortable) to oxfords or other dress shoes.

For the money I think that this is a great shoe; however, I will say that I think that if your child has a wide foot then you should probably order a half size up in the wide. My son has a wide foot and normally wears a 6.5 wide but when I got them home they felt a little more snug and were more difficult to get on this foot compared to his usual Stride Rites or Jumping Jacks shoes. Overall for the price this is a cute and comfortable shoe, just bear in mind the wide isn't quite wide enough.
I purchased these shoes for my grandson.  They are very light and true to size.  
These are my favorites! My two year olds are so cute in them, but I wish I had gotten wide width. I always forget that those feet are so fat! They fit pretty true to size but can be narrow on those fat baby feet. 
Great shoe for toddlers.  My daughter loved the red color. The shoe runs narrow, especially in the heel area, so even though I  bought a larger size, the shoe fit well because of the narrow heel.
