SKECHERS Interval
I was very  surprised based on other Skechers I ordered (which I'll be returning.) These were not only incredibly sporty and stylish ( a bonus, not a requirement for me) but fit well for my size 10.  They were not stiff.  With a bouncy feel, they propelled me forward which is what I want for my exercise walking.  Insoles are removable but at first, they seemed not as they are spray glued in.  So just tug and they come out, I put my custom orthotics in.
