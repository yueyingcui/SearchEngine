Salomon X Ultra   
Just discovered this brand and so glad I did. Love this shoe, feels like walking on pillows. No break in period or rubbing. Great support but not too much which tends toward stiffness in other shoes. I use for every day walking and light trail hiking. Fit is true to size. Love the pull string instead of laces as it's quick and evenly tightens.
