Brooks Addictionâ„¢ Walker 
I have been looking and looking for the perfect shoes for my tired, sore feet. The Brooks are a perfect fit, I wish the sole were a bit softer like the New Balance 927, but these shoes just fit me perfectly. Following the reviews I ordered up half a size. I ordered them on Monday and they were at my door on Tuesday. All in all this was a perfect shopping experience.
