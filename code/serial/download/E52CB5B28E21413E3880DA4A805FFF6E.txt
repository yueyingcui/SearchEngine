Circa 205 Vulc
I will give a quick review on the skateability of these shoes. First off, in terms of sizing, I felt these shoes to be a little narrower than other shoes of the same size. My pinky toe feels a little crushed if I wear these for too long. Also, in relation to the no arch support marking, that is because all skate shoes are flat - there is never any arch support. The outer is a tough suede that has held up to abrasion so far. The sole is very grippy, and the vulcanized rubber allows a lot of board feel. The insole is very poor - that is my only complaint. I buy Dr. Scholl's for all my shoes to avoid heel bruising, but these shoes needed them just for wearing around town. They do need a breaking in period, but I also prefer to have a more flexible shoe when I skate. These just felt stiffer than other brands that I have tried. However, now broken in they feel great. I do not skate in them as much as my other shoes simply because they felt a little narrow.
Awesome, comfortable & cute shoes. They did run a size small and I had to exchange. Love them!
My son was absolutely thrilled with his new shoes! They are great looking shoes, that are well made, and fit perfectly true to size. They are also very comfortable.
I bought these shoes for my son who has trouble getting cool shoes in wide sizes. These shoes were plenty wide and had really nice cushion and arch support.
WOW - 
I have a large foot and I have to get men’s sizes, I tried this shoe on a whim and I will never go back to a different shoe, I didn’t have to break them in, and they lasted me 2 years and are still working great, I could probably get another year out of them...LOVE THE SHOE, recommend it to anyone with picky feet!
