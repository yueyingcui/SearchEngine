Stride Rite SRT SM Leo (Infant/Toddler)
These are great first shoes for your little one. They protect the foot while having a flexible, bendy sole. I also like the size chart on the insole. Would definitely buy again!
I love the way these shoes look. However, I had to exchange them 3 times before I found the right size. The size I ended up with still doesn't fit, so now I am stuck with them. If your child has a wide foot, I do not recommend these shoes. My son can't even wear socks with them, and they leave marks on his feet .
