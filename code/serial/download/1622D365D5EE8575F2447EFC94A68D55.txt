SKECHERS Urbantrack - Forward
Very nice high quality shoe.  Comfortable, correctly sized and good looking without being an over-the-top runner's shoe (worn by a non-runner).  
Great looking, but awful sizing. They're one full size oversized. They have long toe which makes them difficult to walk on. I literally spilled a full cup of coffee three floors down on the stairs at work because the toe section in these shoes is way too long and I tripped.
I bought this shoe to replace a pair of Skechers I bought 3 years ago. Not only are these shoes far more comfortable than my last pair but they also fit better too! The shoes look classy and aren't too shiny. The grip on the back of each shoe makes it easy to kick them off and overall I feel like the shoe is a well thought out design. From the comfort to the thumb-sized groove in the back to make putting the shoes on easier, I'd rate this as one of my best shoe buys. I'm betting they'll last a long time too which is great for such an affordable shoe!
These shoes are incredibly well priced, and look awesome. They're extremely comfortable, and very versatile from a color point of view. They're true to size and width. They look a little big, but that's just the Skechers design. I would highly recommend this shoe.
