ECCO Welt Sneaker Tie
I really wanted these shoes to work out, but I ended up returning them. They run larger than listed, and unfortunately don't come in half sizes (9-9.5 is two sizes, not one). The sole is comfortable. The all-black style is good. The width and bulk is a little grandpa-ish, unfortunately. I think they could have trimmed the fat a little to make these look sleeker and dressier. Worst part is the ankle collar around the back of the heel. It bulges and is sewn, which makes for an uneven surface right at a primary pressure point in the shoe. I don't know if that wears in, but I know that I'm uncomfortable with paying good money to risk that. The backs of my heels were sore after about 20 minutes of house-wear.
