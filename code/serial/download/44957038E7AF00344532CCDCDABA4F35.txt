Romika Milla 62
I loved these shoes.  Had to buy a size larger, but I have neuropathy and the wide toe box works well.  I also could use my orthotics with them.  I have hard to fit feet and I am happy with the walking comfort and support.  Worth the money.
These shoes are absolutely fantastic. It is nearly impossible for me to find shoes that fit, wear well, and do not press or slip in all the wrong places. I wore these shoes out of the box and they are only getting more comfortable. I am a true size 7Â½ normal to wide width and I got size 38. They fit perfectly. There's room for my toes with no crunching and no slipping at the heel either. These are not a sneaker, they are casual shoes. They are ;sneaker-inspired but do not wear or look like sneakers. They are gorgeous European-looking casual shoes. I have the brown leather and it goes so well with jeans. I live in a very hilly city and these stay put and comfortable going up or down hill and on rough city pot-hole ridden streets; indoors they are a charm. The bottom is very supported and this is where it makes all the difference. I have a callous or bunion or something below my right pinky toe and every other shoe hurts like heck when I walk more than a few minutes; these shoes do not hurt at all. They keep pressure off the ball of the foot and the toes.
