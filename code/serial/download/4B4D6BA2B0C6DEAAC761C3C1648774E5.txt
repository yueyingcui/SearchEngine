Nike LunarSwift+ 3
These shoes have been amazing. I have pretty flat feet and these do an amazing job of supporting me in ways other shoes have not. I ordered half a size larger than I usually wear and that seems to be the perfect fit.
Great shoe. Looks good and is super comfortable. I thought it ran a little large. I usually wear a size 11 in Nike and had a little more room in the toe than I would of liked.
Great shoe - seems to run a bit narrow and small, need to order the next (full) size up.
Very pretty, but almost impossible to get on, and way too tight! I usually wear a size 6 of Nike, but for these shoes I don't know if a size 7 would fit.
Very comfortable shoes.  Get a 1/2 size up or wear thin socks if you do not like that snug feel.  I love them because there is no tongue and the shoe fits snug all day.
