Saucony ProGridâ„¢ Ride 5
I am a first-time marathoner, and I have made it through my dreaded 18 mile long run in comfort wearing these shoes! Extremely cushy and took some getting used to the extra cushioning (compared to the older model Brooks Adrenaline). I was fitted for these shoes based on wear patterns that showed the Adrenaline were giving me too much guidance. I am a size 8 in street shoes and take a 9.5 to give me room in the toebox. Great shoe!
I love my new colorful shoes, and so does everyone else.  I have been a ProGrid shoe girl since version 2, yes there are some changes, but nothing that would make me change shoes.  I am a very average runner, only 15-20 miles a week.  I did order a half size bigger, but I also put inserts in mine.  At the end of the day, I love them and am still a Pro Grid fan!
Love these shoes! Be warned- the colors are very bright, the laces seem like they could almost glow in the dark...but that's part of the reason I bought them. very comfortable even on my first run. I over probate and find them good for my feet. I ordered a half size up (as I do with all running shoes).
