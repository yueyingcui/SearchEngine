Stride Rite SRT Xavier (Infant/Toddler)
I had gotten these same shoes at a Stride Rite store over a year ago and my daughter started growing out of them. The shoes held up very well and I may even use them for my baby boy when he gets to that size. These orange ones are exactly the same, fit well for my daughter's sort of wide feet (but she is not wide enough to get 'wide' shoes). Also, the insole has the drawing of a foot that tells you if have the right size - very useful. The shoes have great traction and easy to put on.
Just purchased these shoes for my 19-month old son. Absolutely love them! I have always had a hard time finding shoes for him since he has a really wide foot. I ordered these in a 6w and they are true to size and fit like a charm. They have excellent support and are very light weight, not like a lot of other shoes made for toddlers. We have gotten so many compliments on them too. Highly recommend!
