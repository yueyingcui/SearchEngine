Sperry Top-Sider Striper Lace
Great shoes! Very comfortable and true to size. I like the washed look!
These are very well made and comfortable. I prefer a plain canvas shoe with a flat sole so these are ideal. The canvas top ventilates better that leather or vinyl. Unfortunately, Sperry uses a long narrow last and my feet are short and wide. In the wide width these are about a size too long. As a result they are loose and squeak when I walk. This improves with wearing and washing. Would buy again but in shorter size.
Just like the Sperry's of the old days - comfortable, simple, classic. True to size. The perfect in-between shoe.
