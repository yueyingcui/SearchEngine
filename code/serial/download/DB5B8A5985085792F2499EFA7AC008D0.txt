Biom Natural Motion by ECCO BIOM Lite 1.3 Zip
The right shoe is a perfect fit; however the left one is at least a size too big.  too bad.  I loked the shoe.
They are true to your size chart.  Problem is that your size chart is off.  I wear an 8US/ 38.  Your chart stated that a 39 was an 8.  It's not.  I can walk out of these.  My daughter wears a 39 and they fit her perfectly.  Fix your chart or risk all be retlurned.
