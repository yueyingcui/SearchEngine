Sanuk Pick Pocket Fleece Womens
These shoes are so comfortable! I love them! They are nice and casual and look great with jeans or shorts. They run a little big, I would definitely go a half size or a whole size down, they stretch out after a few wears. They also run a little wide, I have really narrow feet so most shoes are a little wide but it isn't too bad. I ordered the grey color and it goes with a lot of things. They are light and can be worn with socks or bare feet.
This is, like, my 8th pair of Sanuks, my 5th pair of this general loafer style. These shoes are just as comfy as all the others I've owned, plus they're extra warm! I usually wear an 8.5, sometimes 9 in shoes because I have wide feet and a high instep. I've always ordered an 8 because these shoes stretch nicely. That, and I bought a size 9 the first time & my husband stole them even though his foot still hung out the back (the back of these shoes are quite thin and do well when you mash the back down to make them slip ons). He's on his 3rd or 4th pair now! These shoes are worth the money for us...we rarely wear other shoes!
Awesome shoes for kicking around. If you are a half size, I recommend buying the size down, as they do stretch a bit. And of course remember, these look like shoes...but are actually sandals, so don't go walking in any puddles - you will get wet!
