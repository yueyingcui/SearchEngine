Pearl Izumi isoTransition
Not only are these very bright with a cool design (I've received several compliments), they are very comfortable - so light weight its almost like wearing nothing.  I'm not a runner so I use them for walking.  They run about a half size smaller than "normal."  I usually wear a 7 1/2 but had to exchange them for an 8. The only negative was the price - pretty steep.  
Love these shoes!!  This shoe runs a bit small.  I had to exchange for one size up.  I think they are meant to be worn without socks.  That could be why the size difference.  They are very comfortable though.  
Awesome shoe. If you use it as a tri shoe, and run barefoot, there is no need to order a half size up. However, if you plan on wearing socks or like more room, a half size up might be a good idea. Though, wearing socks with these shoes is borderline sacrilege; they are so comfortable to run barefoot in. T2 through the finish just got easier.
I wear a 10.5 street shoe and always buy 11's in running shoes...these run a full size small and I had to get an 11.5. These are very light, minimum stability shoes. That being said, they are perfect for triathlons, are made to wear without socks, no-tie laces and they look great! Nice shoes.
This is my first purchase of a Pearl Izumi shoe and I have been very pleased. Good support and the styling looks great. I'm not a heavy runner (more of a cross trainer) and these shoes have been excellent. But them 1/2 size up.
