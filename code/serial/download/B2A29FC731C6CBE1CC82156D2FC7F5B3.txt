pediped Hayden Flex (Toddler/Youth)
These shoes are worth every penney. They are very well made and I love how they have the Flex fit inserts so your child can wear the shoe longer thus getting more mileage. One downside is that I found Pediped to run a size small and had to return the first pair. Order one size up!
