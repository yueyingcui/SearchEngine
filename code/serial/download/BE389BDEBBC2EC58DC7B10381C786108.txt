This shoe in 9W is true to size and generous in a wide width. I usually have to order up a half size for shoes in medium widths. When I first received the shoe, I tried it with the bottom insert only. There was too much toe room and rubbing. I tried it with both inserts and that felt better, allowing my toes to stay in place, but still have some wiggle room. The shoe is smart looking like a upscale sneaker and a lot more substantial in quality and weight. It is a little bit stiff and heavy which I hope will become more flexible with wear. I have the black model and it goes with everything with spiffy gold shoestrings. I think this is a substantial shoe that will last in the long run.
I love these shoes! They are great for problem feet - mine are wide, with a fallen arch and Morton's neuroma on one foot. These have moderate arches, but I put my own orthotics in them. And the footbed is deep enough, so that I don't have to remove the soft insert that the shoe comes with. The soles are squishy, and the interior fabric is soft and smooth. The seams are comfortable. I am so pleased with these shoes! The only drawback is that they are somewhat heavy, but that is so the shoe can offer better support. The shoes take a beating so your feet don't have to! Order down half a size - I take a 9 Wide, but these fit great in a 8.5 Wide.
