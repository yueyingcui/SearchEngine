Saucony Grid V2
Love these shoes! I use them for aerobics-type exercise on a hardwood floor. They're incredibly light and the sole feels very stable on the floor--it grips just enough so I'm not sliding around. The first month I wore them the corners of the shoe by the laces felt too high and rubbed on my ankles, but now the shoe is broken in and I don't feel it. Sometimes the length seems a little short and my toes hit the end of the shoe--when these wear out I'd consider ordering the next size up.
Overall, this shoe runs pretty true to size but I wish the toe box were a little wider. Other than that, the excellent lateral stability is just what I need. Super cool colors too!
