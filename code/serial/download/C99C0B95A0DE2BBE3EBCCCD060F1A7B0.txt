Hush Puppies Power Walker
I ordered these shoes for my Mother who never shopped online but has trouble finding comfortable shoes in the stores.  She was impressed with the free shipping and free return policy so agreed to give it a try and let me order them for her.  She was thrilled.  The shoes are more comfortable than she expected and came in her hard-to-find size. A great experience overall.
Very nice shoe but was much narrower than expected, I couldn't get it on my foot at all but the other two pairs (different brands) that I ordered at the same time as this shoe, same size and width, fit fine.
Ture to size. I have a wide hard to fit foot and these shoes feel good on my feet. 
I ordered a size 9 for my mother. She was happy with 1) price, 2) speed of delivery, 3) comfort, 4) size was generous which allowed her to put her orthotics into the shoes.
