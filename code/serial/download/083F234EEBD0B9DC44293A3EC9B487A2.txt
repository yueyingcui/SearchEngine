adidas Originals Kids Samba®  Leather (Toddler/Youth)
This is a great shoe. True to it's size. Lightweight and easy to break in. Very stylish without breaking the bank. 

Very narrow, my son always been happy with Adidas Samba, but when you buy size 10½ or over they become very narrow and not as flexible as the smaller sizes.

Love these shoes! True to size, durable, and perfect for my 3rd grader.

My son really likes his shoes. The fit was good, maybe a little on the larger size. They are stylish and look great with the new skinny and straight leg jeans for boys. They do squeak a little which is weird but overall, he is enjoying his shoes.
