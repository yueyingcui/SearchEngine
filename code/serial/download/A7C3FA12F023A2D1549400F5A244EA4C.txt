Pearl Izumi Womens X-Alp Seek IV
These are a great biking/cycling shoe. I tried on several cycling shoes, and it was really hard to find a shoe that fit my foot appropriately. I first ordered these in a Euro 40, I wear a size 8 in a street shoe, 8.5 or 9 in a sneaker. The Euro size 40 was way to small, the size 41 fits well and I will be keeping them. I like that they are not as super stiff as some biking shoes, and that I can wear them when riding my bike and not just in the cycling class. They are a really nice looking shoe as well.
