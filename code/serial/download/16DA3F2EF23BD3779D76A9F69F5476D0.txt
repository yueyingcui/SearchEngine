Polo Ralph Lauren Vaughn Canvas/Leather
Awesome, fun shoe. Very comfortable and true to size. Didn't know they came with two sets of laces: one set is white, the other is leather. I kind of wish the polo pony logo wasn't as 'bright blue' but I have gotten a lot of compliments on the shoe.
Great shoe, and as always, great service.  Size is always hard to compare across brands, but I normally wear a size 13/14.  I ordered a 14 and it is the slightest bit big, but I am wearing these without socks and I like it that way.  Very good shoe overall.
I ordered them as a Christmas gift for my son. He loves them. They're true to size. They're comfortable and stylish.
