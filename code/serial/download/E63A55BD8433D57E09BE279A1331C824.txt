Merrell Barefoot Edge Glove
I found the arch supports to be very uncomfortable. My feet aren't flat but these shoes make me feel like they are. The arch also feels like it extends too far forward. Merrell shoes in size 12 have always been a perfect fit for me. These are too long and narrow. These are definitely going back. The sole looks like it won't last long off paved surfaces, either. I really wanted to like these shoes but they are way too uncomfortable.
