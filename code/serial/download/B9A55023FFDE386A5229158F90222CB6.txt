Arcopedico LS
I've been wearing this shoes for over a year now. I have a bunion problem and these were the only closed shoes I was able to put on without feeling pain and pressure. I wear them to work with pants all the time, they are amazing! My usual size is 6.5, 37 felt just perfect. It was my first but not last Arcopedico purchase! Get them, you won't regret!
This is actually the third pair of these shoes (third color) that I have bought. They are so lightweight and comfortable and great for walking. While they do not look very attractive, people always ask me where I got them! As for fit, I cannot give an average rating, because I am just delighted to find something that accommodates my size 12 super-slim feet, and I can tie the laces as close as I need to.
Love these shoes.  Had to return for larger size. I loved so much, I ordered another pair in tan.  They feel just like slippers.
Really disappointed. Uncomfortable footbed and at least one half size small. I figured they would stretch like my other Arcopedicos and have worn them two weeks. No better now than day one though the toe box does show my toe imprints!
