Easy Spirit Tallyup
These shoes are very comfortable to me. The size fits me well. I have recieved compliments on them each time I wear them. 
I just received these Tallyups yesterday and thought I'd have to wear them around the house a few days. But, no they are so comfortable that I wore them out today. I have a hard time with my size 9 1/2 and 2E feet that also have huge bunions. Very few shoes are really comfortable for me. These are just like slippers and I'm back now to choose another color. Wish they came in more color choices.
These provide very good foot and arch support. I wear half a size smaller in Drew shoes. I do not much like the appearance of Mary Janes but they are practical.
I am sad to be returning these. They arrived promptly and I got them at a great sale price! These well made, deep navy shoes are wonderfully narrow. That is something that is hard for me to find. The style is delightful. Although these are sports shoes, the design and cut are far from bulky or clunky - instead they have a close and tailored fit. Sadly, they are half a size too short. At least with the pair I received, the style runs so short that my big toe jams the end of the toe box. Buyers may want to beware that the convenient, adjustable Velcro strap is on top of, and hides, a wide elastic band. I walk a lot, including wearing shoes like this for touring cities; and find that the non-adjustable elastic bands can become very uncomfortable as the day goes on and my feet swell a bit.
