La Sportiva X Country
I'm enjoying the X Country. I run in the Vertical K as well, and like the more rigid sole of the X Country. It has a nice minimal feel, and on highly technical trails, the sharp rocks are a little less painful than in the Vertical K. The fit is similar to the Crosslite - go at least a half-size up from your usual running shoe size.
