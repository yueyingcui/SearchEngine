The North Face Men's Hedgehog III GTX XCR®
I have a pair of mid-height and love them. Recently used them on hike to Rockies with great results. TNF makes a size 12 1/2 that is prefect for me. Great boot.
I bought these shoes for my husband. He works as a plant engineer in a hospital and is on concrete floors all day. He loves them and they don't hurt his feet. I personally like how they look. This color combination is sweet! The fit is true to size.
I was pretty disappointed with these shoes as they feel much bulkier and a half-size bigger then the previous model. Also the build quality is lacking as well due to the Toe-guard separating from the shoe within two months of purchase. I exchanged my original 10.5 for a 10 and they seem to fit much better. Now to see how they hold up...
My son greatly recommended these shoes, although I knew nothing about them. My original problem, which still continues, is the fact one shoe feels much tighter and restrictive on top than the other. However, both do have a noticeable pulling sensation across the top of my feet. Thought perhaps half a size larger might help, but that was not recommend by the salesperson.
We were not sure of the size...so we ordered an 8 1/2 and a 9..the 9's fit perfectly - look wonderful - and the return was amazingly easy. The monies put back into our account so quickly for the returned pair. Top quality shoe - wonderful company and  it had been recommended to us by many before - but this was our first attempt. We will definitely do this again. Thank you.
Love 'em. True to size. Comfortable. Waterproof. Warm though if wearing indoors for extended period of time.
These are great shoes. They are rugged, have a hardened rubberized toe, are rigid, grippy and look good. I bought half a size smaller and am glad I did. I measure a 12, but 11½ is the perfect fit.
