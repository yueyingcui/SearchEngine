New Balance BB623BP
I am a big fan of Reebok shoes, however the DMX-MAX model in black is no longer available. Just in white, I used them for work shoes and loved the air cushion in the sole. I had to go to the New Balance listed above, they are smaller in sizes than Reebok's, if you go with NB order at least a half size larger! By the way, these don't even compare to the DMX-Max as far as comfort, but they will do.
Order a size larger than expected. The cushions at the ankles press your foot forward. Although initially comfortable, they wound up tight and uncomfortable.
