Mizuno Wave Nexus G3 Team
Extremely durable comfortable shoe.  From age 3-8 my son has not outgrown an athletic shoe but worn them out.  We have tried every other brand with a general life span of 6 weeks.  He loved his mizuno baseball cleats so we gave these a shot.  It's been 6 months and he said they are actually getting tight.  No parent has ever been happier to hear those words uttered especially one whose child started wearing mens size shoes at 8 years old
This is a great shoe, very light weight, and very comfy.  Current weight is 279, and after losing 48lbs I needed a new shoe for my cardio work outs.  I'd never heard of the brand, but it fits and feels great, and I wear size 15.
