Keen Kids Ambler (Youth)
So far one of the best investments I've made for my child. I kept buying my oldest son shoes at Walmart to get him by because his feet are growing so fast but he's very rough on them, keeps tearing out the toes of the shoes well before he's due for another size. I personally love Keen for the toe protection and after several weeks of wear my son hasn't damaged his Amblers in the slightest. They are rugged, the traction is great and when he finally outgrows them I am confident they will be in good enough shape to hand them down to his younger brother.
