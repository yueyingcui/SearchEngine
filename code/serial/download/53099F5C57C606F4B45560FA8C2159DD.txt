Timberland PRO Five Star Lowry
I have been meaning to write this review for months. But I guess it us good that I waited since there are no reviews with long term usage for these shoes (or maybe I did not pay attention). I absolutely love these shoes. I have been wearing them for about nine months now. I wear them for about six hours Monday - Friday. After two weeks or so of breaking them in, they are just as comfortable now as they were back in January. I might switch the insert at the end of the year. The leather is holding up better than expected. I have only used a damp towel to clean them. I am not really sure how you go about cleaning shoes besides taking them to a shoe place. The shoelaces are also holding up nicely. Lots of times with cheaper shoes that is the first thing to go. I really have nothing bad to say about these shoes. If you are in the business get them. They are so worth it. Just note that I think you should get half a size smaller than you would usually get on other type of work shoes. I usually get a 10, these I had to get 9Â½. Everyone's feet are different so do not hold me up to it.
