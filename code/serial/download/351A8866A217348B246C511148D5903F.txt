Converse Chuck Taylor® All Star® Seasonal Hi
I bought these at the request of my 15 year old Daughter. She originally chose her standard size which were too small so we ordered the next size and they are perfect. She is wearing them with her skinny jeans and they look great!
I always go back to Chuck Taylors.  They're the most comfortable, neutral on the feet.  You can wear them to the gym or a night out on the town or for some urban hiking.  My only complaint is that I wear a size 8 in every other brand except this where I have to get a size 7.
You cannot go wrong with a pair of Chucks! Like everyone says, they run big. So go half or a full size smaller. I went down half a size and I am good to go!
Excellent sneakers. I bought them for doing squats and deadlifts. A flatter shoe is exactly what I wanted. They are also attractive and well-made. Be sure to buy one full size smaller than you usually wear (I wear a Men's 9 but my Chuck Taylors are size 8).
I wear a women's 8½ and the size 8 fits fine. The shoes are not comfortable however, they have a very flat stiff sole without arch support. I tried adding an after market arch support, and the sole is still too stiff for me to walk in. I suppose for the price one is lucky to get shoes to begin with.
I love these sneakers.  I don't know why this color doesn't come in half sizes, but these shoes run large, so order either a half size or full size smaller than what you normally wear.
