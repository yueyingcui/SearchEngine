New Balance W880TR
Very nice shoes. Unlike most New Balance models, this one is made for a neutral to underpronator. Plenty of toe height. Supportive, but firm cushioning. I was a little worried about the color, but it's surprisingly understated. I recommend ordering a half-size up. I wear a 7 in most shoes; a 7.5 fits great in this style.
