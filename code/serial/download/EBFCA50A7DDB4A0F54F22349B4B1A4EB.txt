The North Face Men's Hedgefrog Pro
I had to return this shoe and get a half size larger. Once I had the proper size they have been exactly what I was looking for. I spent a lot of time looking for shoes like this. I tried some that were too narrow and seemed to be made to wear without socks but these are perfect. Good with or without socks, can be worn on a hike or to the river, etc. or for a long day of working on my feet. There's nothing more refreshing than feeling the breeze blow across your feet while you are working outside.
