New Balance Classics W801
Awesome shoes and true to size. So comfortable and easy to get into and out of if you're in a hurry.
First I got a 6, but my little toes seemed a bit cramped, so I returned and got the 6 1/2. Maybe it just all the stitching inside and the way it's designed in that area...but the half larger size was no better. I do like the stretchy bit across the top, but the inside is just really uncomfortable.
I bought these for my elderly mother who has very small, wide feet. On top of that, she needs great arch support due to plantar fasciitis. She had very specific requests for shoes and these fit the bill on all counts; slip ons, size 5.5WW, athletic shoes, white. Perfect!
Warning about inaccurate size chart! I wear Euro 41-42 which the size chart said was woman's 11. I ordered size 11 to get a box labeled Euro 43 /Woman's 11. The shoes were Euro 43 -- too big for me.
These are great shoes! Very comfortable to wear, and easy to slip on and off. They have a good amount of support. I found them to be true to size and got the Wide width which was very comfortable. New Balance always puts out a good shoe.
After buying 5 pr of NB 801s, this is my least favorite. The size was different from the others, they are so light weight that they seem cheap, and they just aren't as stylish as the others I've had. I loved the comfort and fit of the 801s but this pair was a huge disappointment   
This is a comfy shoe, but not so good looking on my long foot, so I wear it more as a slipper around the house. I did have to return it for a whole size smaller. As always, return and shipping was quick and easy. I will only give it 4 stars due to my personal preference, but it is a nice shoe.
Very comfortable shoes that feel like bedroom slippers. This is my second pair. They wear like iron and stay looking good a long time. Good buy for the money. They do run small so I get one size bigger.
