Nike Lunaracer+ W
Great racing flat-lightweight and flexible. Snug-actually, they fit like a glove, but expected because they are racers. Order a half size larger if you want more wiggle room.
Love these shoes! You feel like you're bouncing in them. I couldn't believe how light weight they were when I took them out of the box. These are great shoes! I think they might be sized a little small. I normally wear a size 7, but I had to return them for a 7 1/2.
After reading reviews from other sites I decided to order a half size up. Even a half size up felt tight at first, but after a few runs they're breaking in nicely. Definitely a narrow fitting shoe, though, so if you have very wide feet it might not be too comfortable. Also, the heel curves in a little in the back and I got blisters my first two runs so be ready for that. Overall, after some breaking-in it is very comfortable and light.
