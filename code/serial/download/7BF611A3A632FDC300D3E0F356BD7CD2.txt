The North Face Men's Ultra 105 GTX® XCR® '10
These are the most comfortable hiking/work shoes I have purchased in the last few years. They are true to size. At first they were a little stiff but after a few hours of wearing them they felt just fine. So good that I bought a second pair. I'm using my own orthotics for better arch support.
