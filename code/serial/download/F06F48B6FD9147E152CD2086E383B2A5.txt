Puma Kids Whirlwind V (Infant/Toddler/Youth)
My 3 1/2 year old's favorite color is green and he saw these shoes as I was searching for shoes for his little brother. He was so excited to see green shoes and I was happy too because I loved the retro feel these have. Well since he got them he hasn't worn anything else. They seem to run true to size cause I ordered his normal 10 1/2 and he says they feel great.
