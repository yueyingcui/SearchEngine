Nike Sweet Classic Canvas
Loved the look of them, but I can't believe more people didn't think these run narrow.  I have wider feet but can usually deal with it when it comes to any shoe just not this time.  Have to send them back.  I do think these felt true to size though if anyone is wondering.
I gotta say, I love these sneakers. Damn comfortable, true to size, and seem to keep clean pretty easily. So far so good on durability as well. I really like the style. Would have liked a more neutral accent color than the green, but it still goes with pretty much whatever.
My husband thought these weren't very comfortable even knowing the canvas would break in.  Felt true to size.  Also beware, the tags come in different colors - red or white - which somehow I missed.  He kept the Sketcher Arcade Refers.
Love these shoes! They look great, fit well, and they look great. Did I mention they look great? Shipping was super-fast, as usual, and they fit perfect right out of the box. I am size 11 and the 11 fit, no issues. Can't wait until I need more shoes, I know where I'll be looking first.
