Nike Action Isolate LR
I'm not sure if I got a defective pair of shoes, or if this is just a shoddy model.  I was excited for my new pair of shoes, but they felt a little weird when I put them on.  The size was correct, and exactly what I expected.  But, while I was walking, the right shoe specifically didn't seem to "fold" correctly at the toes.  I thought I would just need to break them in a bit, but after 2 weeks, I am starting to develop a bruise on my big toe.  Sending them back to try a different style.
