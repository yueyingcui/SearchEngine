New Balance Kids KT20 (Toddler/Youth)
Incredibly cute shoes!  Very lightweight, so especially nice for summer. The fit seems true to size in toddler size 10. Cannot speak to durability yet as have only had a couple of weeks, but we will put them to the test as my 4 year-old daughter doesn't want to take them off.
Love the look of these! My son said they are very comfortable. They are true to size.
