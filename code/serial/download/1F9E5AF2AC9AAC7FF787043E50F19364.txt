ASICS GEL-Uptempoâ„¢  W
I would definitely order 1/2 size down. I'm usually a 9 and the 8.5 fits with room to spare. I spent a long time researching which shoe would be best for all of my plyo-heavy workouts.  This shoe is perfect. It's okay looking. It seems like most sneaker design tends toward tacky, and these are tolerable enough that I could feasibly wear them when I'm not exercising.
Shoe is narrow, so not a good choice is your foot is normal-to-wide sized. I didn't feel too much cushioning, either. Back it goes!
