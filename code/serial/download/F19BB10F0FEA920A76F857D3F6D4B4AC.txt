Onitsuka Tiger by Asics Runsparkâ„¢ LE
These shoes were amazingly comfortable from day one. The size was exactly as expected. The materials are top notch, though you need to be prepared for a softer leather than on other shoes. They were wrinkled from day one, but I think it adds to the style of the shoe. I liked them so much that I bought another pair in green.
I wear an 8 or an 8 1/2 and these fit perfectly in the size 8. I've got a narrow foot, and these fit, which is rare for me to find in a tennis shoe. I got the green color, they are really cute. they are low profile and not bulky, which i liked.
