Nike Air Monarch IV
A month after breaking them in they started squeaking whenever I step down. I've never had a pair of shoes do that before. I have found Nikes are a full size smaller than marked. I normally wear 8 but in Nikes I wear 9.
love the shoes they seem to run a little small so plan on a larger size. At least that was my experience
Nike Air Monarch IV are the most comfortable everyday  shoes I have ever owned. I have owned(worn out)several pairs and I always need a half size larger than normal. They naturally run a little on the wide side but not enough to be an issue for me.
