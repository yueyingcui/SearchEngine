New Balance M990
I'm a walker, not a runner, but I walk a lot. I wore the New Balance 991 for several years, and these are just as comfortable, and a little lighter weight, too. Like the 991's, I found that a half size larger than my normal size works best. Overall a really good shoe.
Great shoe, in fact, the only running shoe I can find in a 15AA.  I have purchased the 990 line for over 15 years.  There is one design flaw however.  Most people have a foot that is about a half size shorter than the other.  In my case, it is the right foot.  What I find that happens within the first few months is my big toe on my shorter foot comes up and hits the webbing rather than the leather on the toe.  The result is a hole forming in the webbing material.  NB needs to bring the leather over the top another 1/4 inch and that would solve the problem. 
Most comfortable shoe I have ever owned. True to size;great if you have a very narrow foot
I have tried various running shoes, and this 990 is easily my favorite. They offer excellent support, and a glove-like fit. I tend to pronate, and these shoes offer ample cushioning -- but somehow they are not heavy shoes. In fact, at 12.2 ounces (size 8EE), they are quite light, and they feel even lighter. They weigh over an ounce less than the Asics Evolution 6 shoe (13.5 ounces, size 8.5EE). An added bonus is the fact that the 990 offers a nice, conservative design. So many running shoes these days look like wild kaleidoscopes of strange patterns and colors. These 990s look great, and the miles seem to glide by. Additionally, the fit around my ankle is better than that of other shoes. They feel good and snug, yet comfortable. Other shoes have felt somewhat loose around the ankle, especially in the back. In terms of overall length, I would say these shoes are slightly beyond the "true to size" measurement. I highly recommend the NB 990, and am happy to support American manufacturing.
