Supra Cuban
Like 'em enough to try for an exchange - Wow, I've never worn a pair of slip ons that were this comfortable. I'm a size 10 1/2, but ordered size 11 & they fit perfect. The only problem I had with these slip ons that I've never had with any other pair of shoes that I've owned is the craftsmanship. Brand new out of the box, one of the shoes out of the pair was already coming apart at the front seam where the sole meets the body & there were smears of dark grey sticky residue on both sides of the same shoe that would not come off. They hadn't even been worn! On the other shoe were red specks of who knows what; there's nothing red on or in the shoe that could've rubbed off. I'm satisfied with the design, am satisfied with the quality of the shoe for the price. They're comfortable, they're everything I had hoped for except for the craftsmanship and the spots that wont come off. The spots aren't a big deal to me, but if I wanted to buy shoes that were falling apart from the get go I would have bought some from a thrift shop. All in all, I like the shoes enough to at least see if I can get them exchanged.
Sick Kicks - 
I already had the Skytops in a size 10.5, perfect fit, so I decided to get the Cubans in a size 11. For about a day they fit painfully tight and I almost returned them, but they stretched out a bit I guess and now they fit like a charm. I have gotten so many compliments on these shoes it is ridiculous. They are so unique, I've never seen another person rocking them. Definitely a good buy!
