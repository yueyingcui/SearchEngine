Sperry Top-Sider Laceless CVO
These are not good fitting shoes. I have tried three different sizes (their sizes are not at all accurate) and I cannot get a pair that feels good on my feet.
Great sneakers.  I love the slip on design.  The seersucker plaid is very summery, looking great with white capris.  True to size.  Comfortable to me.
Great classic sneaker. As mentioned by others they feel like they run a half size large but it doesn't cause slippage or discomfort. Cute with jeans, shorts, skirts. Will likely order another pair this summer.
Love the way these shoes look!  I usually wear a size 8, so that's the size I ordered.  The shoes feel just a touch tight in terms of the width, and just a touch short, but I'm hoping they will stretch out and be fine.  I really like them.
These are great shoes, though they seem to run a tad big. I ordered a 7.5, my regular size shoe, but I think a 7 would be a bit small, so they're kind of in-between. nevertheless, they are wonderful shoes. Comfortable and built well..and very cute!
