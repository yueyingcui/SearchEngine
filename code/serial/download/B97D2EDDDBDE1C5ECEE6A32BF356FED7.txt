PUMA Faas 250 Trail
Straight out of the box the shoes are comfortable and feel broken in. The design is almost like fitting into a sock -- no stiff outer molding. Very lightweight, nice padding, and perfect balance of arch support. This is where function meets form. I've worn this every day since purchasing 5 days ago. Love em. True to size with Nike and Adidas.
