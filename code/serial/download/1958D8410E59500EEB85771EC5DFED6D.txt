SKECHERS Bikers - Hot Ticket
Comfortable, stylish, overall a great shoe. I ordered a half size up since my feet are slightly wider, and they fit great.
I love these shoes! I was looking for a pair of comfortable walking shoes that don't look as much like running shoes. These are exactly what I wanted. They are extremely comfortable as well. I'm always either a size 6 & 1/2 or 7 & it ended up that the 6 1/2 was better so if you fluctuate between sizes, take the smaller one.
I got these for summer sneakers. I love these shoes! comfy from the get go. True to size and width. And in grey/aqua the cool colors for summer.
Skecher shoes and I always get along great! These were the very first sketchers I'd ever had to order a half size larger because of length. Comfortable from the second you put them on! Recommended!
