Vans Old Skoolâ„¢
I love these shoes! I feel they run true to size, but they do take a little time to break in, the heel of the shoe is a little hard so I had to wear a band-aid  on each heel the first few times I wore the shoe to avoid blisters. All and all it was worth it! They look great with skinny jeans!

Really like the way these shoes look and feel. They run a little big so I had to return my first pair and get a smaller size. After that they were great.
