Scarpa Zen Lady
Finally, a low top hiking boot that fits and is made well. Very sturdy. Roomy toe box, and snug heel. I do feel the top of the shoe on the top of my toe/foot area slightly but I don't think it will be bothersome. I went with a 1/2 size larger due to hiking and thicker sock.
All I can say is Wow! These are some of the most comfy shoes I have tried, and I am a size 11 with a surgically repaired foot. They are wonderful. Lots of room for a thick sock, no toe bang, great looking, sturdy, and top quality. I love them so much that I will get a pair of the high tops. These will be excellent shoes for non-technical hikes in the Colorado foothills. Where have these shoes been all my life!
Bought a half-size larger and they fit fine, plenty of toe room. Comfortable too, but unfortunately I really didn't need these shoes now, so back they go.
