ASICS GEL-Excel33â„¢
These are great sneakers, they're very lightweight but still supportive. The cushioned collar is really nice after your first run - my first time out it chafed a bit while it formed to my ankle but now it really just hold the shoes in place. I wear a 10 - 10.5 generally and I ordered an 11 in these (I always size up in sneakers as feet tend to swell when you run...), and it's perfect. They have a nice wide base which is good for my wider feet - these probably wouldn't work for a narrower foot.
I really like the color of these shoes and maybe in a half size bigger they would be perfect, but something has changed with Asics sizing. I have 2 pair of older Asics shoes, both 7.5 (my usual size). Ordered these in a 7.5 and they are too small. Arch support seemed a little off too, maybe just because the shoes are too small? Shoes seem a bit too snug all over and I'm not sure all that can be attributed to the smaller size. Very different fit than what I'm used to with Asics. Awesome looking, try 1/2 bigger.
I ordered a half size up for running comfort and don't feel I got it. Feels my regular size. Also a little narrower than usual. Last pair were Nimbus 12 so that's what I'm comparing to.
