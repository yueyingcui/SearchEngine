Converse Auckland Racer Ox
These shoes have a great old school look to them. I was pleased when I received them. They're great with jeans and shorts. One thing to consider is that you may need a half size bigger because I wear a size 11 in all my other Converse shoes but needed an 11.5 in these shoes. I had to send the original order of size 11 back. Hope that helps.
