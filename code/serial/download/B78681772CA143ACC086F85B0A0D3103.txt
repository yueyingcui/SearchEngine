pediped Adrian Flex (Infant/Toddler)
Nicely made, flexible, but twins outgrew size before given at Xmas. Reordered in larger size. Size adjuster inner sole great feature.
I balked at the price of shoes for my 14 month old, but these shoes are amazing. My son's feet are a full size different, and very wide. These shoes are cut wide, and we were able to use the insole in one shoe to even out the size difference in his foot. These are great shoes for kids who need special shoes. Oh, and my son absolutely loves them. He actually gets excited to wear them. I think he realizes how cool they are.
These shoes are adorable, however the worst pedipeds we have ever gotten! My daughter loved pedipeds, and these we got for my son in his true size, and the tongue doesn't open all the way so it makes it impossible to get his foot it. It is is true size because he has plenty of room once in there. What a waste of money.
Excellent shoes. I purchased them for my 3-year old son. He is very active, loves to run, jump. His feet are relatively wide, size 26 worked well. There is an actual instep support which I find lacking in most toddler shoes. The design is smart. There is a piece of Velcro on the tongue that would prevent the it from bunching up, even though I do not think it would. The design allows my son to take the shoes off and on by himself as well. The shoes are quite light and seem to breath well enough. I will buy Pediped shoes again, no doubt.
My five year old loves this shoe (size 28). It is rather wide, but so soft and flexible and he refuses to wear anything else. I told him that he'd be outgrowing them soon and he'd need a new pair and he flipped out. He likes that he can get them on and off without even undoing them. I suppose I wish they were a little tighter on the foot so that he had to actually undo them to get them off/on, but if doctors recommend them, I suppose that's what I have to go on.
