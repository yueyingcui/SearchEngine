Nike Nike5 Bomba Pro
I really liked this shoes. I'm an Adidas fan after all but I wanted to try something new. This shoes are very comfortable and resistant. And the Nike style is pretty awesome. You should buy a 1/2 size more than your normal size because this shoes are narrow. The turf was great for me because I play soccer 5 vs 5 in a synthetic grass and the first time I tried this shoes I had no problem at all. Highly recommended.
Excellent shoes. Great for turf. Great control and feel. Order half a size smaller - upper stretches.
