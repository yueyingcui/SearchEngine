Nike Kids Free Run 2.0 (Youth)
Purchased for my 10 year old daughter. She loves them! Great color. Very comfortable. She wears them all the time. Purchased a half size larger just to give growing room and size worked perfectly.
I loved the Nike Free 2.0 so much that I purchased a pair for my 10-year old son after his feet weren't feeling great after a trek in his Vans. These shoes feel great right out the box. As with all our running shoes, I purchased this a half size bigger to allow for expansion during workouts. My son loves his new kicks. An overall great light minimalist shoe.
Bought these for both of my children and they love them! Ended up exchanging for half a size bigger.
Excellent shoe. Size one size small (Nike 6Y old shoe slightly bigger than this 6.5Y) Returning for larger size.
I wear 6 1/2 in women's but ordered these in kids sizes because I liked the color. Best pair of tennis shoes I've ever bought. 
They are smaller than my daughter's Toms, which were a 3.5 also. Trying a full size up.
They are very nice shoes. I would recommend not getting a size bigger than you usually wear. I'm usually a 7 in women's shoes and I got a 6.5. They came very big! Also, if you need extra arch support, these are a little flimsy.
Nice looking shoe. I got my daughter 1 size bigger than what she would normally wear. Suggest only going half size.
