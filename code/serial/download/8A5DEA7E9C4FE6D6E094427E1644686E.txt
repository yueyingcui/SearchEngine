Nike Kids Jr Nike Premier 3 FG-R Zappos Exclusive!
Great shoes...they were perfect for my daughter who wanted some pink in them! They fit well and true to size. I got a half size bigger to fit the thick soccer socks. The tongue is smaller than others but fine for us. I help her put her shoes on anyways. Great deal especially since the quality is good, too. I would purchase these again!
These are super cute cleats in a hard to find size. My daughter just moved into a size 9 toddler, and she wears these with two pairs of soccer socks, and has room to grow. The tongue does not always lay as flat as I wish it would forher comfort, although she has never complained about it.
