New Balance MR940
This New Balance model runs small.  I had to return it for a larger size. I suggest ordering the shoe at least 1/2 size larger.  
Competitive price, free shipping, and a no hassle return policy. Tough to go wrong here.... shoe is high quality, fits according to size ordered and was received the next day.
An excellent shoe in my opinion.  Tried several NB styles from the 800's through 1200's and this shoe was by far the best I tried.  True to size, holds heel well without slippage like other brands, and solid construction.  
I don't do tons of running these days, so I won't comment on how they are for that.  I had been wearing the 850's for years and switched to the 940 when they got discontinued.  I am very happy with these.  The 850's ran a half-size small for me, but the 940's are back at my normal size, although they are narrower, so I had to get the wide.
The MR940 is supposed to replace the MR850, a nice stability running shoe. This one doesn't compare favorably to its predecessor. 1) They fit differently -- much roomier in the toe box and not as secure in the heel. 2) The overall fit has changed. I wear a 8 1/2 in an 850; but the same size in the 940 was really tight; and when I reordered the shoe in a 9, they were considerably larger than the half-size difference. Also, the cushioning in this shoe is greater than the 850, not as firm in the forefoot, but good firmness the heel. Also, the shoe has added flex throughout the footbed. I'm going back to the 850 -- the 940 is far from a good replacement for 850. I feel that NB missed the mark upgrading a good stability shoe.
