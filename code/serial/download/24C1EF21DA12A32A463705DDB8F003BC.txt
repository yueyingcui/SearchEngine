ECCO Sky Strap
I ordered the Ecco Sky Strap last month and I love it. I ordered my usual size ahd it is so comfortable. I highly recomend this shoe.
I am very pleased with this shoe. Fit is true to size, deep enough in heel to hold orthotic insert, and stylish. I am so happy, that I ordered 2 more pairs for fear the style becomes unavailable. Small dislike is the strap could be 1/2 inch longer, but it is sufficient. ECCO makes high quality shoes. Zappo's rocks!
