New Balance WW855
Love the shoes.  Perfect for working out in the gym.  Not as much support as a shoe made for running or long distance hiking, but then I don't need that in the gym  Very stylish.  Fits great. My size is 9N
Really like these shoes! Light and cute. Very stable and good ankle support also which is important for a long, narrow foot like mine. The only con is that the tread design picks up small rocks! I walk daily on natural ground so that is a little inconvenient! NB still runs small so order up a size.
