Vans Zapato Del Barcoâ„¢ Core Classics
This pair of Vans are very shinny and I get lots of compliments on them. The bottom of the shoes give my feet really good support and I also feel very comfortable with the bottom. The size is a little bigger than it is marked but within a comfortable range. The only part customers have to pay attention to is to keep the shoes clean. They are shinny but easy to stain. They are nice shoes overall and recommendations to you guys!
Great customer service.  It's hard for me to find shoes in my size and they've always been a great help. The free overnight shipping let's me shop without fear of waiting for an item and great for wick turn-around with exchanges. 
Great shoes. Although I would like to know how the laces are setup like the picture so they are not showing the knot. They look good for formal beach weddings. Also I think they fit a little big for the size. I normally wear a 11 1/2. but these are a little big. an 11 would have been better.
These are great shoes. They're very stylish and comfortable, but they run a little big, so make sure you get the right size.
Love the shoes, but they run way big. I normally wear a 12 or a 12.5 depending on the brand. Normally a 12 in Vans and these run a full size larger than normal. I ordered them in an 11.5 and then returned them for an 11 and they fit great. Definitely size down a full size to get the right fit. If you get these too big they aren't comfortable (I have an old solid black pair in an 11.5) because your foot will slide forward and jam your toes in the narrow front.
