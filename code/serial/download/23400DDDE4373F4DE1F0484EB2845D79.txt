Zoot Sports Ultra TT 5.0
This shoe may be designed to be worn sockless, but proceed with caution...at least blood washes out of it really well. The back heel comes up really high for a running shoe, and it gives me gnarly blisters on my achilles if I wear these without socks. So I wear socks, and I am fine. Even with putting socks on, these shoes are on my feet and I'm running in seconds. The shoe doesn't have a lot of cushioning, but again, socks help that. However, these are the very best shoes to wear for a rainy day or a mud run. I can go through waist-deep puddles in these, and the water just pours back out. They don't even get heavy when wet. They wash up extremely well and dry out perfectly too. I was also surprised that they don't get that wet shoe smell either. I normal arches and a neutral stride. I'm not sure if these would do well for an over-pronator or not. These are true to running shoe size.
Love my new Zoots!  Unlike others, I thought these ran small -- I'm always a size 8, but even without socks 8 was too small and I had to order an 8.5 in these.  With that said, I love these shoes!
