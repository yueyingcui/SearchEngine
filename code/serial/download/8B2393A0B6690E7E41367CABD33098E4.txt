Avia A5792M
This model eschews the ubiquitous cantilever heel in favor of the new "Compression Cushioning" or just CC. What this consists of is two carbon rubber structures comprising the midsole and supporting the foot. The upper one is flat and directly under the foot. The second structure works as a suspension bridge which absorbs and attenuates shock upon impact. The shoe is very comfortable and the CC cushioning provides a plush ride. The 5792 is ideal for training in the gym with weights and machines, treadmill, or mid-mileage running outside. I got some compliments as well as chuckles from the neon colors so I also ordered the more sedate-looking black-orange-white model. I hope Avia goes forward with the compression cushioning technology as it provides a plush and comfortable ride and good stability. I found that this model runs slightly larger. I am usually a size 10.5 in most shoes. But feel like the 10 fits me better in this one.
