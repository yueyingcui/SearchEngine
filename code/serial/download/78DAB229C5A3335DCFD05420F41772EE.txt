Nike Kids JR T90 Shoot IV IC (Toddler/Youth)
Great shoe for indoor soccer and/or casual wear/play. Fits true to size.
This is a futile shoe, but also perfect for other indoor gym activities. Good for daily use as well. Cushioning and ventilation is much less when compared to running shoes because this is a soccer shoe. Very comfortable shoes regardless. Relatively wide and roomy at instep but true to size.
Good feel for ball control and lightweight. Runs a half size larger then adidas.
