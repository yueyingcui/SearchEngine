New Balance MX623
I always find it difficult to buy shoes because of a wide size.   As soon as I tried these sneakers, I knew I had found the perfect fit.
I have extremely wide feet, and have been wearing a New Balance EE, which is still a bit tight. I ordered this in a 4E, or extra wide, thinking it would be more comfortable, but the shoe was much narrower than my New Balance EE. I don't think they're true to size in regard to width. They were so narrow the toe was almost pointed at the end.
There aren't a lot of cool-looking shoes for people with big feet like myself so I was pretty happy to find these. I ordered a size 16, width 4E pair and have been wearing it for months as an all-purpose shoe. If you want to really set it off, lace it with some brightly colored shoelaces!
They fit well, better than similar models which have a protrusion that catches and folds under at the instep when you put them on. These have no such 'feature' and the wide widths are true to size.
The shoe looks great and is of a solid build. However, unlike other NB it is narrower then stated. I've ordered 4E wide NB shoes before and they've always fir great. These pinched. Order a size higher and you will be happy.
Manufacturing changed from China to Vietnam so now fits one size small, so 10-4E instead of 9-4E. Very comfortable, ordering another pair.
