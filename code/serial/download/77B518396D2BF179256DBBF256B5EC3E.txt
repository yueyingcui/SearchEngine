Sperry Kids Bluefish (Youth)
Fit is good - true to size. This is what all the kids are wearing to school - so my daughter is cool in school - but the shoelaces do not stay tied! And they get dirty quick, but this is what they wear.
This shoe is by far one of my favorites next to classic short Uggs. anyway. The shoe fits awesome I'm a size 5.5 and there is still a little space which I like.
This is my second pair of Sperry's, and I love them both! I'm on a my feet a lot, and these are some of the most comfortable shoes I own. I recently found out that, although I wear a 6.5 in women's Sperry's, I also wear a 4.5 in youth Sperry's. The youth sizes are so much cheaper, and the quality/fit/comfort is the same!
Great shoes! I bought these for myself, since it's very difficult for me to find my size. They're very comfortable. I walked in them for hours on my last cruise. 

We love the shoes, but we did have to exchange for the wide size. They seem narrow.

Awesome shoes. They were "approved" black shoes for uniform code. Fit true to size.
I ordered the wide for my daughter because she often complains about the tight fit even if they are her size.  These fit perfectly, and she loved them as soon as she stepped into them.
Shoe was super cute, but sizing couldn't be more off.  I ordered the size 6 youth for my 13 year old, and it was even huge on my size 7.5 adult foot. I ended up selling it to my adult neighbor who wears a size 8 and has wide feet.  Defintitely not "youth" sizing.
