Shimano SH-M162
I ordered five pairs of shoes, four different brands from four different sources (price conscious). I thought the sh-m162 was going to be my least favorite out of the five because of the various reviews that I had read, although they held their own in the forums. They were also the last of the five that I ordered. Over a three week period and I wish that they had been the first pair! They provide awesome arch support, fit true to size and feel great both on and off the bike. These also have real insoles. They actually felt great out of the box and get better the longer you wear them. They are only slightly heavier than the all-plastic soles on other brands, these are rubber soled and grippy. They are very easy to walk in, and give your great power transfer. They are not race great, but great none the less. They also feel like they will be durable.
This is the best looking, most uncomfortable Shimano shoe on the market. I'm a mountain biker, long-time Shimano shoe-wearer. I was thrilled with these shoes, amazing design and features until I put them on. I am flat-footed, and these shoes are narrower with a higher arch than any Shimanos I've ever worn. I also wear a 46 in Shimanos, even though I'm a 11.5 in running shoes, but these 46s were a half size too small. Returned them and got the SH-MO87G instead and am very happy with those. Plus saved some green!
