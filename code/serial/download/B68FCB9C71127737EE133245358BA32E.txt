Columbia Kids Switchbackâ„¢ Plus (Toddler/Youth)
My son is very particular about what he wears and these are his go-to shoes now. They're true to size, and rugged. We hike in the park together a few days a week, and these shoes really fit the bill. I do have one complaint and that is that the top of one of the straps is separating from the Velcro. I'm sure it's an easy fix for someone who has a sewing machine and knows how to use it, but I'm not that person sadly. I will take it in to have it fixed, and this issue would not keep me from buying these again. I still wholeheartedly recommend them.
