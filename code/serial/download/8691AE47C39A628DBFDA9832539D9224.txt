New Balance Classics W801 Komen
Very nice shoe.  Felt true to size and width,  perfect for casual but nicer than an athletic shoe.
Wonderful shoes. Very comfortable. This is my second pair. This pair for some reason did run small, so I had to exchange for a larger size.
Love this shoe but I have to send back for 1/2 size smaller. They are true to size. I sized up by mistake. I also think that the cushioning is not like they used to have on the 801 style...my old pair seemed to have a lot more bounce plus the elastic throat was much stronger.
Love this shoe. Perfect for running in and out. The only thing I would suggest is getting a half size bigger than what you normally buy. There is a band around the back and it rubbed on my heel so I had to return and get a bigger size.
I was looking for an open-back sneaker in black and pink, so I looked first at New Balance since I owned the same style of NB's for years. This shoe however, doesn't have the same fit in the same size. The upper does not rise up high enough to get your foot in all the way, and the insoles are topped with a slippery polyester that doesn't allow a barefoot or a sock to get a secure feel. I don't walk in them, I shuffle to keep my foot inside. I recently bought Dr. Scholl's insoles to trade out for the slippery ones. Hopefully they will make a difference because the color and style are perfect!
