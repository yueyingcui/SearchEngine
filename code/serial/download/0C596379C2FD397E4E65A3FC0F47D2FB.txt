New Balance M580v2
I've had (4) pair of the New Balance M58 over years and don't see any reason to change. It's a great walking shoe for someone in their mid sixties and it's a US product to boot! Double bubble! I'd recommend this shoe and any New Balance product any time. The size seems to be a little snugger than the last pair but the comfort level is not an issue. Maybe order yours a little larger in width and size. My opinion.
These shoes are so light and comfortable, I have really enjoyed them so far. I've been buying New Balance for quite a while because they always hive my size and width 14 4e, a difficult size to find in a shoe that appeals to my taste. They style of these shoes is great, they have a clean modern style with minimal flashy shiny stuff. cant go wrong with new balance and these confirm that.
