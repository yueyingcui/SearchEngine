Nike Action Mavrk
Finally found a pair of Nike sneakers that fit! Im a size 15 and most Nike's I have worn needed to be a 16 because they seem to be sized small. These fit great, feel comfortable, and look good. I just wish Nike's other "Action" versions fit the same but the are a half size smaller.
I have wide feet and at first this shoe was a bit narrow up at the toes. A night out with them and they stretched out and now fit perfect. I usually wear Nike 6.0 Encores size 10. A 10 in the Mavrks fit just as good. Comfortable, but definitely not a shoe to wear for a lot of walking.
