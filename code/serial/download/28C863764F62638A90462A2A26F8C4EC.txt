Merrell Moab Waterproof
I'm not really a fan of the style, but these shoes are great. I did a 17 mile backpacking/hike the first day I wore them. Didn't need any breaking in and they are waterproof as they say. I always get a size 11, but had to get the 11.5 in these.
Not great for the money. The fit is way small, at least a size and a half small maybe even two sizes, with an odd feel in the way the insert fits to the sides of the shoe. Laces won't stay tied.
These run about whole size too small. I'm a pretty good 12 W, but I'm sending these back for some 13 W.
This seems to be a good replacement for the Merrell Radius, which has been discontinued. Being from Seattle, I like a shoe that stays dry in damp conditions. I also appreciate being able to get a shoe in wide sizes. The fit seems a touch smaller than the Radius (perhaps a quarter size).
An excellent shoe. Unsure of the long-term quality, but it held up to a month of punishing hiking, biking, and trudging about. Very happy I chose the waterproof model. Invaluable during one trudge through soppy, dewy fields. I was the only one with dry feet. Knocking a star for the fit; I run 10.5-11 and ordered this in an 11, and it's a bit tight. Would probably go 11.5 next time. Felt a bit narrow too. Not a deal-breaker, and I clearly survived intact, but my feet were happy to stretch out after long hikes. Definitely recommended, although I wish I'd had time before my trip to exchange for a half-size larger. Leave time to experiment with sizing!
