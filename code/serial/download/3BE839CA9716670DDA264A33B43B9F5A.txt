Nike Air Max Tailwind+ 4
(Female) I buy men's for the width (I have flat feet). The width of these shoes fit my feet very snug. It feels like a women's shoe not men's. I also needed a half size larger. Very stylish and comfortable to run in.
Love the shoe, fits me perfect! True to size and pretty spiffy looking. I have a pair in black too. Love them too!
I was very satisfied with the product and the delivery time. It was my second purchase. Both sneakers were very true to size.
This Nike Air Tailwind is a good buy, but you have to buy a size bigger if you like comfort because they fit small.
I purchased these shoes for my 18 year old grandson...and he says these shoes are so comfortable. The size and width are both true to fit. He and I both are very happy with this purchase.
Nike Tailwind supports my 215 lbs. frame nicely and fits true to size. I trust these shoes like no other.
