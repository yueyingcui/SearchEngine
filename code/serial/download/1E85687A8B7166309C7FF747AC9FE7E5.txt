etnies Kids Fader Vulc (Toddler/Youth)
These are great skate shoes! I wear them myself (adult female size 7, so got the boys 5.5). They are very comfortable and stylish. No need to break them in.

They were a little big and not true to their size. I spent 1 day skating for 1 hour, and they are about to rip. Not very good for running but very comfortable.
