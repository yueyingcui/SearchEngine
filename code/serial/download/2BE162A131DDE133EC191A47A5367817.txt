Nike Free Advantage
These shoes are the worst! I am a huge fan of Nike (even have a tattoo of the swish), but I am so dissatisfied with these shoes. I first go off of look. I think Nike gives lots of different looks with colors, which I like. Then I go off of comfort. Not being able to try them on, obviously that was not something that I could tell. But I went with my gut. These shoes are So uncomfortable, the tongue is paper thin and plastic, the fit is smaller than my normal size and more narrow, and there is no support. I now use them to just walk around in. I would not use them at all for the gym and definitely not a run. Poor job, Nike.
