Nike Action Ruckus Low
These were for my 12 year old son.  He loves them.  I like them as they are a nice color combination and are the oversized skater look.
Usually wear a size 12, so I bought a 12.5 for extra measure. Smaller than my other size 12's from the store, gave it to my brother.
This is a really cool shoe. I just got them today. I went and did some errands while wearing them. They have a very solid, yet comfortable feel. Consider ordering a half or one size bigger. They are kind of snug, but nothing major. They probably will stretch out a bit. These are great shoes for a great price.
Had to get a whole size up. Fit great now (after ordering 12, & returning). Goes great with shorts & jeans. Love the retro look and colors.
These are a pretty comfortable shoe. Make sure to buy probably a full size, half a size at the least when purchasing. I don't understand why Nike's sizing is always so off. The full size is probably imperative for someone who has wide feet like me. I'm a 12 and even the 13s are kind of tight on the small toes. Also, get some nice neon orange laces for these things. It looks way better than the white ones that come with it.
Very nice shoe. Very soft and surprisingly light. But, get half a size larger than you plan to. 
Great sneak. The outer sole is a little hard to clean, but if you ever owned any Nike shoes (i.e. Delta Force, etc) then you should be familiar with the sneaker.

Overall, really comfortable but I suggest going a size up on this sneaker.
It's a good look. Have gotten lots of compliments. Great orthopedic grey with Kelly green for fresh contrast. Nikes will run on the narrow side, but still true to size.
