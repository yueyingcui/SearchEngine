Nike Lunar Edge 12
I was looking for sneakers to use for the P90X program because the sneakers I had been using hurt my feet and were pretty heavy.  I picked these shoes for their lightness and support, and I am by and large pleased.  My feet get a little achy on occasion, but definitely a lot better than it was.  I was hoping they'd be a little cooler looking in real life, but they're not.  But overall I'm happy with the purchase.  I would get a half size larger than what you normally are.  I got a 12.5 and should have got a 13.
I typically wear a size 16 in other shoes, and as expected, needed a size larger with Nike. Having said that, these are very comfortable and well cushioned shoes. I am enjoying wearing them as a daily shoe.
