These are so cute, but they give me blisters on the backs of my heels like I have never experienced before. I was hoping I would just need a 'break in' period, but I have worn them a few times and still the blisters are forming. I'm sad! I normally wear an 11 and originally ordered that size. Way too big. So now I have the 10 and they fit much better but there is the blister problem. These unfortunately are not the shoe for me. I normally have no problems fitting shoes.
Really cute and comfy loafer! The sparkles kick them up a notch. Had to order a half size smaller because they are a little roomy.
