Rockport On Road-Prowalker
Great walking shoe!  Have ordered this particular brand and this particular shoe over and over!   Fits true to size and is very comfortable with no break-in time required.
Overall the shoe is good but not great. The shoe length seems to be true to the size, but not the width. I have a 2E width and the shoe could have been a bit wider. Also the sole cushion could be a bit more padded.
I tried to replace my previous pair of Rockport Prowalker shoe M9046 71H5 Tan size Wide 10-1/2. I was told that this shoe was discontinued and replaced by APM35519. I was disappointed to find there were no eyelets to support the lace holes, and this style seemed more like a bowling shoe than a walker. I am returning this shoe and will continue my search for a replacement of my previous shoe. I will however stay with Rockport shoes; they are comfortable walking shoes.
