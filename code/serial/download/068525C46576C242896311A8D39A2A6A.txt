New Balance MX856
My foot has a low arch and is very flexible so I have a lot of pronation. I tried other brands that either didn't offer enough motion conrol or were too wide. I purchased the narrow size even though none of my other shoes are narrow. This is a solid shoe, but it is nowhere near as sexy looking as other trainers offered by other brands. But looks don't matter as long as it gives me enough support.
Great shoe with width and length true to size. I have the 6E and found the 9.5 to work well. I am taking a 10-4E when I can't get the 6E. Soft on the foot but adequate support. This shoe measures about 4.25 inches at the heel to top which give my ankle some stability.
