Brooks Ghost 5
Great running shoes with ample support and structure. Happy to find size 11.5 for the purposes of sizing up! 
I bought these shoes in size 12 for my 14 year old granddaughter. She loves them and says they are very comfortable. She wears them to school and out and about. The colors are very attractive and they provide good support.
