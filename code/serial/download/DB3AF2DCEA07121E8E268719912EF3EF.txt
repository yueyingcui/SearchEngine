PUMA Mar Mostro
The size runs larger than the Puma driving shoes. These are definitely something to wear in a water related activity.
After four pairs of red SFs for all my manual transmission cars, I wanted a good pair of motosport-like shoes in Red (sidn't want to insult my new red Lotus with the prancing horsie logo). While still can be used for intense drives. I picked this pair up since the video review called the shoes minimalist. They look a lot cooler in real and the soles are so thin, I could enjoy decent pedal feedback while still getting very good ventilation from the fish net / honey comb / octopus suction cup mesh or whatever it is called. Minimalist running shoes these are not but work very well as driving shoes and I could definitely see myself wearing them for my jetski-ing and watersport activities like it is intended. Ordered it yesterday before 1 PM and promptly received it today. Note on size: For someone who is a wide 42, I always pick 43s in Puma motosport but I decided to go with the 42 instead since the upper is very minimal. Fits nicely enough without crushing my digits. Ordering true to size worked well for me.
