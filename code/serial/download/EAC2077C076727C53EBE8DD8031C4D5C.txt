Converse Work Turnover
Overall, these shoes are the most comfortable shoes I've worn, and fit true to size. The problem is that the heels are glued on, and within four months of use, the heels started to break down and the glue did not hold. 
Spending this much for a pair of shoes for four months is not a good investment. I'm a helicopter maintenance technician - that involves a lot of climbing, and these shoes do not hold up very well.
