Keen Siskiyou WP
I use these shoes for biking and hiking, they work very well and are very comfortable. Just a note, I had to get a full size bigger, as they run small. Also, if you don't absolutely need the water proof version, these shoes do make your feet a little sweaty, small sacrifice for the extra protection though. Good looking, good support, good shoes, did not give me achey feet after a long hike. 
Great shoe! Fits true to size (I wear a 14). Great hiking shoe that is ultra durable.
I have many pairs of Keens.  These are very good quality, but about 1/2 size too small.  I would order 1/2 size bigger than normal, even if you have 10 pairs of Keens, all another size.
Bought as gift for husband who is a pretty consistent size 12. These shoes ran small, were rather heavy and inflexible for what they are (low hikers) and were generally uncomfortable. They look nice, but plan on ordering a size up and having them be heavier and less comfortable than you expect.

Felt like a nice solid shoe but feels nearly a full size smaller and narrower than my other pair of Keen shoes.
Great shoe but disappointed with the fit. Not enough arch support and a feeling that the heel is slightly to high and tipping you forward. Had to order 1/2 size larger.
I have four other pairs of Keen shoes or sandals, and all fit great and are true to marked size. The Siskiyouâ€™s, however were not. I had to return my regular size (great return policy BTW) and get a half size larger. The comfort is good, not great. Maybe it will get better with use.
