Minnetonka Leather Moc
These seem to run a little narrower than other Minnetonkas, like the Kilty style. I am thinking they will stretch out a little as they are worn. They also seem a half size shorter, but still fine if worn barefoot.
I did consider what other reviewers said and ordered half a size smaller. I am glad that I did because I planned on wearing them barefooted and they fit perfectly. I am also a person that usually needs a lot of support in the arch and heel, but these feel fabulous on! The first day after I got them I wore them for the whole day and absolutely loved them. The complete leather footbed feels luxurious next to the foot. I got them in the white and they resemble boat shoes so they look good with capris.
Super cute alternative to the ever so popular boat shoe. They are true to size, but some might find them baggy on the sides as they do fit just like moccasins. Got them in a 10 as they are more like a real shoe than the true mocs I have from minnetonka which  I got in a 1/2 size down. Love the red color, too! Perfect for summer/spring. 
Love them with skinny jeans. But so bad that they do not have an arch support, what makes them not perfect for long walks. When ordering them I was afraid that the red color would print on my feet first few weeks and it's not! Overall they are well made, true to size and made in Dominican republic.
I love these shoes. At first they seemed sort of unevenly floppy around the sides, but I cranked the leather lace tighter to hug my narrow heel and they've relaxed into a lovely shape. Good toe box room. Very flattering to my thin feet, comfy, true to size. 

The soles are flexible and thinnish, so I wouldn't recommend them for walking on gravel or for anyone with super sensitive soles. 
These shoes are so soft and comfortable right from the start. I can't wait to wear them all summer long! I ordered a half-size smaller than usual; I like a snug fit.
