Supra Cuttler Low
I like these shoes. They've got style. Unfortunately, that means this shoe has a shallow toe box. Order a half-size up. I normally wear an 11.5/12, and the 12s (in leather) are a bit too snug with mid-weight socks on (the 13s are a better, but too long). They're plenty long enough, but the toe box is tight on top. The good news is, I can fix them with a bit of stretching. Otherwise, the leather and canvas ones are high quality (the black mesh version has a flimsier lightweight sole that doesn't seem like it would last as long as the leather/canvas version).
