Five Ten 5/10 Dome
So the one star review is not really a good view of these shoes. First they are not boots. They are for everyday use or day hiking. They fit pretty true to size and same as other 5.10s that I own. They have excellent grip, which is expected. They are great shoes for their purpose.
