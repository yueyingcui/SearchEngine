SKECHERS Liv-Smart
These are easily the most comfortable walking shoes I have ever worn. I actually look for reasons to wear them! I don't know if they would hold up to my running workouts...I'm an overpronator, which requires more interior arch support, but I am more than pleased with my walking workouts. Would love to purchase them in additional colors, but were not available in my size.
These shoes are perfect for walking miles. The toe box is wide and the "roly-poly" bottom is even out making for safer lateral moves. I ordered a half size up (I wear a 9 and ordered a 9.5). I can wear my comfy Thorlo walking socks.
Love the lightweight aspect. Fits well. I usually wear wide but since they don't come in that, thought I'd try this and the mesh is so flexible they feel fine. Went to 1/2 size larger. Not as much cushion in the heel as the original walkers I got - the old version but still have put miles on them and my feet feel good.
Very comfortable shoe. I got exactly what I expected. Perfect fit to my normal size. No need for socks with these shoes. The rocker style base took less than a day to get used to. Well worth the money.
The shoe fits very true to size and is extremely comfortable. The curved base isn't too thick either so the shoe doesn't look as funny as the old style Shape Ups did.
