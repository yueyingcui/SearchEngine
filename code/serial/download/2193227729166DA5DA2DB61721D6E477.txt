Mountrek Scuba Skimmer
I just bought these for a trip to Cancun and they fit great initially. I wear a 7 and 1/2 but I ordered a 7 which was still too big. They were extremely comfortable out of the water but once I walked into water and swam around a bit, they expanded and kept falling off. I wasn't in more than 4 feet of water and the pressure of the water kept pulling the shoe off. I recommend going down a full half size or even a one and a half size smaller. The shoes must fit very snug otherwise, once in water they will slip off. I loved them anyway so I reordered in a smaller size!! Great shoe!
