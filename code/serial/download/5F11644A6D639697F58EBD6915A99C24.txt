Nike Zoom Rival D 6
Very comfortable shoe and it seems to be true to size also. I would highly recommend them. 
Nice shoe, quite comfortable according to my daughter. Shoe runs very small, at least one size.
The shoe looked really pretty.  I ordered size 7.  Was too small and the quality looked poor.  I was really disappointed.
