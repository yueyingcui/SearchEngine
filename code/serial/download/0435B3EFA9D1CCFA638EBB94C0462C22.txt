Newton Running Women's Distance U
I love these shoes! They fit great, are perfect for cross training and the bright colors are fabulous. I ordered a half size smaller than my running shoes - fit to a tee.
Newtons have completely changed running for me - I've had years of injury problems and this shoe has adjusted my gait and posture in such a way that I have had pain-free running for the first time since high school. I would recommend researching these shoes and how to ease into running in them if you are a new user. Also, I have found the sizing to be a little tricky because of the way that your foot is aligned with the raised portion of the sole. I've gone down in size from my previous running shoes. These shoes do wear out more quickly for me than other shoes, so that is certainly something to consider for the price. However, after running in Newtons I will probably never return to the standard running shoe.
