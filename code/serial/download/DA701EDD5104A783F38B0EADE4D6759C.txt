Stride Rite Jade Lighted (Toddler/Youth)
4 year old daughter loves these shoes, the color and lights are her favorite! These, and other similar Stride Rite styles, tend to run smaller, and narrower, so if in doubt size up in both areas.
My 5 year old daughter was so disappointed when her eagerly anticipated light up shoes didn't fit! Her last pair of Tsukihoshi's still fit her but were developing holes, so we bought the same size 11W. Unfortunately, these Stride Rites were too tight for her :(.
