ASICS GT-2170â„¢ Trail
I had high hopes for this shoe. I usually wear the Asics Kahana but the new version of that shoe does not feel the same. So I have been looking for another Asics shoe that works. I ordered a size 6 1/2 (based off other reviews) and it seemed a little bit too large length wise; I know that a size 6 would be too small though. The other thing about this shoe is where the arch support is; it seems slightly off. The shoe is really good looking though! Just a bummer that it didn't work out for me.
I have been wearing Asics shoes for a number of years. This is my third pair of Trail runners and so far I am pleased with them. I think the colors are very attractive (grey/pink/light blue). The toes are a little bit pointy in comparison to my regular Asics running shoes so there is more room at the end of the shoe than in the same size regular Asics running shoe. If I went down a half size, though, the shoe would be too tight. I wear an orthotic and if I remove the insole it fits just fine. (In my other Asics I don't need to remove the insole.) I really like how lightweight they are.
