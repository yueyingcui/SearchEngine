ASICS GEL-Upshotâ„¢
I had to return the shoe. Frankly, the style is nice and it appears to be well made. The problem is that the inside lining is so thick, that it makes the shoe feel too tight. The length is OK. So getting a size bigger would only make it too long. In short, Asics should make this shoe wider to compensate for the extra lining.
