adidas Outdoor Terrex Solo
The shoe is comfy and a great everyday wear. My boyfriend wanted them to hike in, and now he wears them daily. I was shipped a size 9 instead of the 10 we wanted, but they still fit him well, so we just kept the 9. Overall great company I will for sure shop in the future.
