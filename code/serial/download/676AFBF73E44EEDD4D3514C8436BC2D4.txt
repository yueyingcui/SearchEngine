Five Ten Maltese Falcon
The size: I normally wear a US11. After reading the review of another person who said they ran a half size small I ordered the US11.5. Interestingly they are labeled EU45 which is always the size I've been in cycling shoes. The form: They are a good looking shoe on or off the bike. The sole is quite thick and the shoes look quite narrow so if you're after that wide skate shoe sort of look then these probably aren't the shoes for you. The function: They feel good walking as well as riding. The sole has a good balance of flex which offers good efficiency on the bike and enough flex to be comfortable when off the bike walking uphill. It is not an aggressive tread pattern so not sure how it would handle in mud. Works well on the stony/dusty trails I'm riding for now. I have fitted Time cleats to the shoes. I am using the ATAC Z Strong pedals and have not had to do any trimming of the sole. They do however protrude a bit so they do scuff up if you walk around on concrete. The soles are stiff enough that I don't feel the cleat pushing up into my foot. Once out on the trail a couple of times I got pins and needles around the ball of my foot after riding for a while but wiggling my feet made it go away. I think this may be in part to the stiffness of the shoes. The liners are quite thin - I think upgrading to a more shock absorbent liner may do the trick.
