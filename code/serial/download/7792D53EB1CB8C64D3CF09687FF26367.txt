SKECHERS Blissy
I found these slip-ons to be true to size with a flattering fit. The one minor complaint I have is with the innersole which has a satin finish. I find my foot slipping, especially if I am wearing socks. I like the brushed finish on the innersoles that Skechers used to use much better.
I love them! I have them on right now. They are very comfortable and the size is perfect (so if you're a 6 1/2 get a 6 1/2). I had similar Sketchers for the winter with the fur inside and they were also great and this is why I purchased these for spring/summer and I'm happy I did!
I LOVE these shoes. Soooo comfortable. No breaking in necessary. And they are good looking on and kinda funky. Run about a size too large, so glad I ordered a half size smaller than what I wear in an enclosed shoe.
