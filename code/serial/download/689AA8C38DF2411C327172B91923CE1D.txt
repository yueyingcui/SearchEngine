Nike Zoom W 3
This shoe is everything that I had hoped for. It is lightweight and very comfortable to run in; perfect for the 400 and 800 meter events which I do. The design is also distinct and the colors are accurate to the online image; I have gotten many compliments! Finally, I got half a size larger which was a good decision (but that is what I do with all spikes because they are smaller than casual sneakers).
