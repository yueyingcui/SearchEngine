New Balance MW735
I was surprised at how light these shoes are. They fit well and are very comfortable, and very stylish. They also make my size 11 feet look significantly smaller than they do in other shoes, which I sort of appreciate!
I normally wear a size 15 in New Balance shoes, however this pair was a little too small. Returning...
Fantastic shoe.  Very comfortable.  I'm tempted to buy multiple pairs lest I wait and find that they are discontinued or somehow changed.  I wish the shoe was a little easier to slip on.  With my next pair, I'll probably go a half-size bigger.  There is no true 'tongue', so the opening for the foot is a bit snug.
