Sebago Schooner
I just got my Sebago Schooners. The look is very nice. They are soft and supple. I ordered size 11, WW. They seem too narrow for me. I am not sure what WW means, but I need a double E, and I do not think these are it. Although they might stretch out, I hate to take a chance. I, unfortunately, will likely return them.
One of the few good looking shoes in an extra wide size, this brand is a great choice.
I bought the Sebago Schooner along with the Sperry Top-Sider at the same time. Yes there is a large price difference but after comparing the two, it was obvious which ones I would be returning: Sperry. The difference in construction and materials is astounding. The Schooner really are great shoes, and comfortable too. Since I do not wear socks with them I decided to order down half a size and I also ordered a W, instead of my normal D width after reading that they tend to run narrow. I was skeptical at first with the sizing, after wearing them for a few hours, they really came into their own. Though all the colors of the Top-Siders and Docksides are nice, I prefer the more traditional look of the Schooner.
If you are looking for comfortable shoes to wear with jeans or shorts these are the ones to get, although as far as comfort goes I do like the Dockers shoe better but these are equally as good. I wear a size 14, and since my cancer I have swelling in my feet these days which led me to get the wide width. They fit true to size and are very comfortable. I recommend these shoes to anyone.
I really liked the look, but I could not find a size that fit me. I normally wear a 9½ size. The 9½ size slipped on and off as I walked, but the 9 was too tight. Additionally, I found that the sole did not offer much comfort or support. These were my first boat shoes, so it could be that I am not accustomed to the size/fit.
Seem very nice, but size way off! I wear either a 13 or 14, but these 13s were huge on me.
