Nike Kids Shox Roadster (Youth)
I have been wearing Shox Turbo's in size 3.5 youth forever.  This sneaker is too long by at least one half size.  I ordered another pair of Nike at the same time. They too were too long.  So, perhaps the last has changed.  The Roadster does not feel the same on my foot as the Turbo.  And the tongue on this shoe is very short and does not stick out beyond top of shoe.  I returned both pairs of sneakers.
