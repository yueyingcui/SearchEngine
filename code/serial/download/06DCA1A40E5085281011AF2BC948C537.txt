Keen Kids Coronado Print (Infant/Toddler)
These shoes are perfect! My daughter is two and she loves wearing them. She can put them on by herself and they are so well-made. I bought the next size up so she can wear them all winter, too.

They are made just like adult Keens, so the toe box is wide. My daughter has extremely narrow feet, so finding shoes to fit can be a challenge. These are great!
Love these shoes. We have bought many pairs of these shoes in different sizes for my boys (the boy version, of course) and my girl. They are easy to get on, comfortable, wear well and cute. Just don't put them in the washer because the back can break down. Otherwise they hold up well.
These are the greatest little shoes and my daughter gets compliments every time we're out! They are easy to put on and they seem comfortable to her - she doesn't mind having them on all day. They are also easy to clean (they've seen many a mud puddles already) - just rinse them in the sink and they dry out great. I'm going to buy these in the next size up when she's ready!

These are adorable and seem to fit true-to-size. My only complaint is that the sides are stiff and the top edge is a bit rough. The Keens she grew out of had an edge finished differently, with a sort of velvety ribbon, that softened the edge. I might not have noticed except my daughter scraped her ankle and these shoes kept scraping the scab off. Once she healed, she seems perfectly comfortable in them. They appear very well made and sturdy.
