adidas Y-3 by Yohji Yamamoto Plimsoll
These look great, very clean, simple, fresh...great for summer. They are mostly made of canvas/rope, they don't seem very durable, I think you need to take a lot of care while wearing them.  They run quite big. I am a size 6, sometimes 5.5, like sandals, so ordered these in a 6, and they are very big for me. All my Adidas sneakers are 6 and they fit perfect. So order half size smaller.
