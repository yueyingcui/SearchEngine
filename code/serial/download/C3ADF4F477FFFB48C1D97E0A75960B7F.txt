Sperry Top-Sider Bluefish 2-Eye
Awesome brand awesome shoes. I get compliments daily. Insanely comfy and no need to wear socks or those hose socks either. Replaced my toms with these, much more comfy and stylish. The fit was true to size!
Very cute shoe but runs way too big. Went down a half size because of other reviews but still not enough.
These are my favorite shoes in the world!  I am a teacher, so I am on my feet all day.  These shoes are light and supportive and go great with capris or khaki pants.  I feel that the run true to size.  My mom has wide feet, and she says they are too narrow for her so that may be a problem for people with wider feet.  I do feel they took a bit of breaking in, but now they seem to get more comfortable with each wear!
Got these for the missus.  They fit true to size and they are comfy.  She is very happy with them.
Awesome! Love these! Very comfy, I bought a half size smaller an they fit perfect. Shipping took a little longer than was expected.
Great shoe. True to size. My daughter loved them. Is already looking to buy another pair!I have a wide foot, this shoe does not accomadate a lot of width in the toe area. I can't wear them...but I wish I could!
Exactly what I wanted! My second pair of Sperry's and I love them even more than my first! I would also advise to get a half size smaller for a comfortable fit. Great go to shoes!
I love Sperry's and especially love the ability to find slightly more feminine styles in size 12. Great quality and comfort.
