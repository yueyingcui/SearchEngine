Shoes were as shown, correct size, but after wearing them for two days the leather started to crack. Of course the return policy says it has to be returned in the condition it was shipped and since they'd been worn I'm stuck with brand new shoes that look like crap. 

I bought these for my 12 year old daughter and she loved them from the moment she put them on. So comfortable and hip. We ordered an 8 because 7.5 was not available, but they fit perfectly. Order 1\/2 size up.
