ASICS Kids JR Rocket&trade; GS (Youth)
I found these looked a lot better in the pictures then in person.  My son liked the way they looked but I thought they looked cheap.  They were very stiff and my son said they weren't comfortable.  They looked like good shoes to go with a school uniform.  My son got the size 2 in black/silver.
My 8 year old daughter loves them, since we purchased these for her to play tennis in, proper fit, support and comfort are important. These shoes offer all three and are true to size.
Nice shoes. My kids need all white athletic shoes for school, and most of them are so dorky looking, I feel bad buying them. These are nice looking, comfortable, and true-to-size. 
These shoes are great! I looked everywhere for a pair of youth sized shoes at a reasonable price. This shoe exceeded my expectations. They are very well-made and my daughter loves them. She says that they feel comfortable.

Short and sweet. The product was what I wanted in the size I needed. They shipped as promised and delivered as promised as well. This is exactly what an online purchase should be.
This shoe is great. I bought them for my 2 girls who play volleyball. They are the only court shoe that I could find in kids sizes. 
I purchased this pair of shoes for my son to play Tennis. Well made shoes and look nice in person! The shoes are a bit narrow in width, but true to size! Good for the price.
