Cool shoes, but Olukai needs to work on their size reliability. I ordered these in silt/tan size 7, and the fit perfect except there was a weird odor to them. I returned them and got the shoes in kona/toffee. These fit a lot larger than the other pair. I experienced the same thing with the Ohana lace up. Had a pair that fit perfect but had some aesthetic issues and the exchange I received fit way too large. Awesome shoes but you may experience some inaccurate sizing.
These are great for kicking on and kicking off coming in and out of the house. True to size for me, but worn with socks. Leather is supper soft and comfortable.

I ordered this shoe for my husband for our Caribbean vacation and they were perfect for upscale casual dinners. Got them in the silt/tan (lighter) color - great with any color trouser, jeans, or even dressier shorts. These fit the bill comfort-wise and style-wise. Comfortable and a SMART-looking "Guy" shoe! PS you may need to go a half size larger than you would normally go.

They are great, but I need to return them for a different size. You service was great! Happy New year!
