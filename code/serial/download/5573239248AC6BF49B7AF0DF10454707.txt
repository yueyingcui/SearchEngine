Prince T22
Sturdy shoes, wide toe box and lightweight considering the heavy-duty construction. I use them for platform tennis and they stand up to the gritty court well. I go one shoe size down for men's shoes for additional color choice.

Awesome tennis shoe. Great fit right out of the box, good arch support, good toe box size. Excellent cushioning when playing on hard courts. Have not yet tried on clay, but from the looks of it, should work just fine.
Right shoe size 9 fit perfectly. I could not, however, wear the left foot as there was some curved surface that was rubbing the big toe underneath; removal of the insole did not help either. Else, left show was good too. I am sending it back. Blame it on my unmatched feet.
order 1/2 size larger. My previous shoe the MV4 fit fine in size 12 but this shoe cramps my toes in size 12.
