Bought these to play paddle tennis. True to size and width; I picked my size (10) and I can fit a finger between my heel and the back of the shoe if I push my foot all the way into the toe box. Talking about the toe box, I have a hammer toe (pinky) and have not had any issues (enough box width and depth). A couple of blisters after my first game, but that's to be expected and now the shoe seems to be breaking in nicely. Finally, this is a pretty slick-looking pair of kicks, not that you should buy your shoes based on this. I've worn them three times so far.
When I received the shoes I wore them to run a few errands to see if any places would rub and had no issues.   The next day I played tennis for two hours.  They are a great fit.  I did order the shoes a half size larger than my regular size.  Long story short, good value, nice looking shoes and perfect for tennis.
Bought for my daughter who is 4'10" and size 6 shoe size. The shoes were huge on her! But she said they were very comfortable in general. Probably would look okay on taller players.
Great fit, style and stability. It has a generously sized toe-box.  Love these shoes!
