Vans Zapato Del Barcoâ„¢
These shoes are great. I got the reddish ones and I couldn't be happier with them. I decided not to listen to the reviews that said to get a size smaller than you usually are. It's a good thing I didn't listen to those reviews because my size 12's fit perfect. The only thing I have to complain about them is that I can't tie them too tight or the top of my feet will start to hurt. Overall, I think this shoe is great and goes with just about anything.
Love the shoes, but they run way big. I normally wear a 12 or a 12.5 depending on the brand. Normally a 12 in Vans and these run a full size larger than normal. I ordered them in an 11.5 and then returned them for an 11 and they fit great. Definitely size down a full size to get the right fit. If you get these too big they aren't comfortable (I have an old solid black pair in an 11.5) because your foot will slide forward and jam your toes in the narrow front.
I love this shoe!  Great canvas boat shoe, and the gray color goes with everything.  I ordered a half size smaller than normal based on other reviews about fit, but I had to return for my normal size.  In my experience, these fit perfect in my normal size, even without socks.  Order and enjoy!  These look awesome with jeans or with shorts, and I can't wait until it gets warmer out so I can wear them all the time.
