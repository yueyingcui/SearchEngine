Nike Vapor Strike Low D 3
As a few people have noted, these cleats are tight. I would go up a size to make sure that they fit correctly. I've had them a few weeks and am hoping that they will break in and loosen up. I've played two games with them and in both games, by halftime, I had to loosen and re-tie them because they were a little awkward/painful to run in.
