Mizuno WaveÂ® Precision 13
Go get it now! Great running shoe for longer distances and races. Lightweight and "springy." I wear narrow and Mizuno narrow is too tight. The b width fits my narrow foot just right. The shoe really locks your foot in the shoe- no heel slide, no rubbing. If I had to compare these to the Ghost 5s that I run in, I would say the Mizuno is a little more zippy and cradles my foot better. The Mizuno heel is more supportive - cushioned also. Color is great - it screams! As always, I get a half size larger than street shoe size.
