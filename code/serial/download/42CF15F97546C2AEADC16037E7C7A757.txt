Globe Motley
When I know shoes that fit are going to be limited, I buy two... I definitely had to buy two pairs of these.  They are extremely stylish and surprisingly comfortable, I wasn't expecting that from a seemingly flat shoe.  

I had to pay attention to the comments that said to buy a half size larger - lucky for me, my size is out of stock so I had no choice anyway.  It was the right decision, they are nice and snug.  I've noticed some people said they don't last long, which is another reason I bought a second pair.   Comfort and style rarely come at a good price these days, even if it they do decide to wear prematurely.  I'm happy with it. 
I ordered these for my son. He liked them but we have to exchange for a size bigger than he usually wears so they definitely run small.
I also ordered a 1/2 size up, and I couldn't even get my foot in these things. They're super tight at the base of the tongue making it nearly impossible to get it on. Sucks, they're pretty sweet shoes.
These run very small. I ordered a half size bigger than my usual shoe size, and it was still too small to even get onto my foot.
Get a half size bigger. These are tight! These feel a little funny when you walk, but an overall good buy.
The Globe Motley is a comfortable shoe with good fit to size in length and width. Great shoe to wear except the only problem I had was the rubber sole was not glued on and kept coming apart.
Nice, simple shoes for a good money! But be aware - they are at least a half size smaller than marked!
This model of Globe Motley is kind of a hybrid between dress shoe and skater shoe. Overall it is very comfortable and stylish, and will pretty much go with any outfit you wear. I usually wear a size 13, but the size 14 fits me perfectly. Order half a size up from your normal shoe size.
