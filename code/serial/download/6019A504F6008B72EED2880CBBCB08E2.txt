Circa Lopez 50
These shoes are very comfortable.  I wear a size 14, and my feet are wide. They fit great.  I use these for everyday wear.
Great fit, true to size, great price, always original - never fakes.
I ordered these for my son. He absolutely loves them. They actually look better in person than online. They are true to size. They are sturdy, comfortable, stylish shoes. I would order them again.
I\'ve had this shoe for over a year and they are still in great shape. Since I have a size 15 shoe, this is great because it also comes in big sizes. Great durability too.
They are good skating shoes. I recomend to buy a half size larger because it comes a litle bit small!!
