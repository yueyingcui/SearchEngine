Nike Kids Hustle D 5 (Youth)
My son, 9, says they are pretty cool. Seriously, do I need to say more? He likes them and wears them every day. He did complain just the very first day that they hurt a little bit when he walked...the leather folded down between the toe and the laces. But I ordered them a half size too big. He wore them the next day and no problems. Thank you.
I purchased these shoes for my son. They look just like the picture and are very comfortable "per him", true to size although I purchased them a half size larger due to his feet growing so fast.
This is the 3rd pair of these shoes that I have purchased for my 11 year old son. He loves them and thinks they are the coolest. I've always found that Nike runs a bit small so I always order a half size up and they seem to fit my boys great. I am very happy with my purchase.
