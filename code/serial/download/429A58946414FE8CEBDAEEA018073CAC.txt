Mizuno WaveÂ® Enigma 2
Like all Mizuno's, a half size small. Don't listen to people telling ya the 2nd version is actually half size bigger, that's NOT true. It is a bit more rommier at the front.

Currently this is the only shoe Mizuno offer for the non-heavyweight runners, at the premium category. If they'd have put more effort in finding better metarial than their stiff not-much-flexible plastic struts, the Creation\Prophecy would probably also be an option.
Anyway, with orthotics the Enigma 2 works great for me, a neutral runner with moderately high arch.

I've really tried all the flagship models and this works the best for me. Comparison:
NB 1080 - Mushy.
Brooks Glycerin 9&10 and ASICS Nimbus 14 - Extra mushy, extra flexible. Not sturdy at all.
NB 2040- Not a neutral shoe, although they categorize this style as such! Too sturdy for me.
Mizuno Creation\Prophecy - too stiff, not for people who weight less than 80Kg. Mizuno designate their flagship styles for the heavyweight runner, which is very sad because avid runners aren't heavyweight.
