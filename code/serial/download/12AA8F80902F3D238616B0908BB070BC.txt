La Sportiva Crosslite 2.0
I got these shoes 3 days before the Black Hills 100. I took them out and ran in the rain and down a creek. Took them home dried them out and ran the race with them. There are no words for how much I like these shoes. They have great traction and shed mud easily. No heel slippage in various conditions. Great rock protection on the sole and toe, for those rocks you don't see in the middle of the night. The lacing is comfortable and smooth. I normally wear a size US 11 and I bought these in the size 45, which would be a 11.5-12 in US sizing. The only thing I wouldn't do is wear these when running on pavement. This is my second LaSportiva shoe after the Raptor, which I like just as much, but I use the Raptor for less aggressive trails. Full steam ahead with the Crosslite 2.0.
I've moved from a stiff heavy leather hiking boot to a low lightweight trail shoe for backpacking/hiking. These worked great for a 25lb pack this past weekend on a 7 mile hike. Fit is great, no heel slippage and wider toe box than the original Crosslites. The built-in lace gaiter kept debris out. Zero blisters out of the box. I had to get one full size up to accommodate a Smartwool sock. Only complaint is they are very slippery on wet rocks so be careful. Also the look of the shoe is less to be desired but I'll always take performance and fit over style.
