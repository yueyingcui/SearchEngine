adidas Kids Goletto III TRX FG (Toddler/Youth)
We just bought these for my daughter for soccer. We opted for a more gender-neutral color since her little brother will likely be wearing them next. She absolutely loves the way they fit and feel. We ended up having to go up a full size in order to accommodate thick soccer socks. A half size down fit her perfectly, so I'd say technically they only feel a half-size smaller - we just opted for another half-size step up. I'd definitely recommend these!
I love these Adidas soccer shoes! They are prefect for my soccer toddler. They do run a bit small so get half a size up from their regular shoe size (my son wears Stride Rite). The upper is very light but he outgrows them so fast, they last as long as we need them and are able to hand them down to a friend!
