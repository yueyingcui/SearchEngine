PUMA Faas 300
Good shoe. I use this shoe mostly for walking and everyday use. They are extremely lightweight and have good cushioning. Very little structure in the upper part. Definitely run narrow so adjust your size up accordingly or avoid this shoe if you have very wide feet.
These are quite possibly the most comfortable sneakers that I have ever owned. They are ultra-light and have a breathable upper, with a soft lining. I wear them barefoot all the time. They hold up well to running (with socks), and add some pop to just about any outfit (well, the tennis ball yellow ones I have do). These are very highly recommended, just remember to order half size up, as Pumas tend to run a bit small.
Great color combo. Fit is good even though I have a narrow size 12 foot. Really comfortable and light, haven't ran in them but I think I would do well in them.
Love these shoes. they are so light and comfortable. They are the lightest shoes I could find at this price point. I was always a Nike Free+ person, but these shoes are just as comfortable and actually even nicer. I would order a 1/2 size up.
I normally take a women's wide width. These men's were the correct width. I normally take a size 9 which translates into a 40. These were a 40.5 and were the right size, so I would say they run a bit short. They are extremely lightweight, a good thing. Not sure how much support they give.

I usually don't write reviews but after using these shoes for a week I have to say this is the best running shoe I've ever used. I was able to shave about a minute off my mile just because these shoes were so light and comfortable. I usually wear Nikes Free but after running with these I can't imagine wearing anything else. Buying a 2nd pair, I would recommend going a half size higher if you have a wide foot.
Fits true to size. Very lightweight. I wanted a slip on and go with no socks. This is it.
