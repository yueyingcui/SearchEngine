Five Ten Coyote Lace Up
A real wolf (or coyote) in sheep's clothing. The Five Ten Coyote was my first climbing shoe, and still remains in my shoe quiver to this day. Since then I've blown through a pair of Acopas and two pair of La Sportiva, but the Coyotes are still going strong. The laces go all the way to the toe, which allows you to get a very precise fit. The soft sole is great for smearing, and the flat knuckle box allows you to fit your toes into cracks and pockets with no problem. While it's by no means an aggressive or technical shoe, there is no reason that these shoes can't be used to climb 5.11. Beginners - your ability won't outgrow these shoes before you wear through them. I'd recommend these shoes for all-day trad climbs, and moderate sport climbs where comfort is more important than edging or precision. While you can certainly use them bouldering, I wouldn't recommend them for that use. Note: This shoe will stain your feet all sorts of red, and depending on how you size, they may stretch anywhere from a half-size to a full size. I'd recommend sizing a half to a full size down from your street shoe, even if you're looking for comfort.
Great beginner shoe, lots of comfort - 
I measure out a 9.5 and got these a half size smaller (9), they stretch easily that much. They are a lined leather, and this is the recommendation from manufacture. I have had a few of these and for a beginner shoe, there isn't one better, rubber is very sticky...some other companies have junk rubber in this price range. They were tight to start with and hurt to walk in, about 3 trips to the gym and they were skin tight slippers, fit like a glove.

Go a size bigger people.
These are great climbing shoes for beginners but if you wear fifteens then you should probably find another shoe. These coyotes felt smaller for a size 15 and they were the biggest I could order. My feet were taking some punishment but eventually, they stretch. Good shoe with a cool look.
