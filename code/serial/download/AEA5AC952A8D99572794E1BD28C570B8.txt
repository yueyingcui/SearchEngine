New Balance WT1110
I ordered these in 11 wide in an attempt to find shoes to fit my swollen pregnant feet. My insteps are extremely puffy, and I was unable to even slip these shoes on. The tongue is attached to the side of the shoe where the laces go in. Therefore, limiting the flexibility of loosening the laces. I cannot comment on any other aspect of these shoes since I could not get them on. I usually wear a size 11 with no issues.
Dark grey and peacock blue, nice colors darker grey than I preferred. I purchased the size 8, my normal size but, this New Balance shoe ran a little wide in the foot and heel area. Great support and good looking shoe. Would have loved to go running in them.
