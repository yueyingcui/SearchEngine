Nike Air Waffle Trainer
First off, these shoes look amazing! I purchased the Anthracite/Volt color and they really catch some looks. That being said, I purchased these shoes half a size larger than what I normally wear (I am an 8 in my Nike Free TRs), and at first wear they feel pretty small/tight. I am chalking this up to a little bit of a sizing difference as well as a need to be broken in. If your feet are a little wide (especially in the toe box area), size up and give yourself some room.
I just got my shoes out of the box, and I was a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong they are nice shoes, just not the shoes for me. I was expecting better shoes to train in, rather than just a good looking shoe. I mean they are called trainers, right? Also they were also bigger than I was expecting. I order the same size as all my Nike's in the past and they had room at the front and in the back.
Great looking shoe. Thick sole. a little narrow in the toe but my foot is a little wide. Plus when you have a size 14 you can't be too picky.
