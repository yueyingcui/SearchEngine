I am very happy with the shoes. My shoe size is typically between a 10½ and 11. I purchased the 10½ and they were a good fit - with some room to spare. They are very stylish and comfortable. The rubber seems to be somewhat soft, so they may wear out more quickly. Overall, I am very pleased.
Eh - 
These shoes are great for skating and have good grip, but they run a half size up. I usually wear an 11 1/2 but for these I should have ordered an 11 cause there a little big on me. But they rip kinda fast but that depends on the way you flick. They look better than the picture though. Had good arch too. 

Pretty good shoe overall...
I bought these shoes because my Fallen Rippers were falling apart from too much skating and these were a good price and Jerry Hsu is possibly the best skater around right now. They didn’t have size elevens when I was ordering so I got eleven and a halves which sometimes fits me sometimes doesn’t. The shoes took me about four days to break in but after that they were pretty good. They are vulcanized and that can be a problem because the grip and kick flip area wear down really fast. I have had them for a month and am already thinking about getting new ones.

These shoes run big. I bought a size smaller than I normally wear. Awesome shoes... lightweight, good grip, super comfortable. I say buy them.

These shoes are Sick!
The size runs a little big but that’s cool cause I wear a 13 and they are really comfortable, esp. after you wear em a few days. I bought 3 pair different colors, I really recommend them!

Great shoes - 
They took a few days to break in, but now they're very comfortable. Very solid heel support, which is nice because I leave them tied all the time and slip them on and off. They look great and they are very proportional in large sizes. I wear a size 13 and they look totally normal - no clown shoe effect at all. I have kind of wide feet and these are perfect.
