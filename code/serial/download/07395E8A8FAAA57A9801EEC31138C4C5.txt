Ryka Transpire
I was looking for an athletic shoe that I could use for all types of workouts.  If it fit well, I think this would be a good choice.  Unfortunately I have a narrow foot and although the heal is narrow and provides support, the toe area is too wide and my foot slips.  Shoe runs a half-size too small, so I followed others' advice and ordered 1/2 size larger which I found to be accurate for the length.
Very happy with this shoe. I wear a 9N, but the medium is comfortable and secure. I rarely need to go up a half-size when others recommend doing so, but I definitely did with this shoe (as well as the Ryka Radiant that I love). I bought an orthotic too but returned it as this shoe gives sufficient support, including metatarsal. The color coordinates well with some of my workout clothes, so it is really a winner for me.
I love my Ryka Transpire!  I wear them to Jazzercise in and they work great!  The fit is true to size also!  I'd buy another pair in a minute.
