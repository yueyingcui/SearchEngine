SKECHERS Smart
In a word: Ahaaaa! I was really skeptical of rocker bottom shoes, never having tried on a pair. The first time I stood up and walked around in these, I was in love. They are true to size and oh-so cushy. I wanted to just walk around the house for the afternoon to see if I really liked them, but I was compelled to go for a walk within minutes. The walk turned into a jog and then into a sprint. I'm sold. I want another pair, or at least try on some of the higher-end model Skechers smart shoes. By the way, the shoes came with a DVD showing off all the models. Great marketing tool; helps making my decision to buy very easy. I'm hooked!
