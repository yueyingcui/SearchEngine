New Balance WT810
Really comfortable shoes with good support.  Wide width true to size-fits great!  My feet are very happy!
Received the shoes less than a week after ordering.  I took them out of the box and they looked huge!  I normally wear an 8.5 or 9 wide, depending on the brand.  I've had New Balance shoes before, which I liked.  I got this pair in a 9 extra wide, since I've noticed that a lot of shoes in wide just don't seem as wide as they used to be.  Well, this pair seemed a full size larger than my feet, length-wise, although the width was great.  I am returning the shoes and ordering a different pair.
These are great shoes. I really like the way they look when I am wearing them and I look down at my feet. I hate most mesh on the tops of the shoes, but this mesh is very subtle. Don't particularly care for the plastic on the side of the shoe but it doesn't bother me too much. Great price. Much less than other New Balance shoes I've purchased. They are very comfortable and fit well (true to size).
