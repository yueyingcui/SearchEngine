Vans LP Slip
These are great-looking shoes and have a sleek simplicity, but there are a few slight issues that hinder their perfection (that haven't been mentioned by other users). These shoes squeak. After wearing them for a few weeks or less, they will make a rubbing squeak noise every time you take a step. You can feel it also. It is so noticeable that they can make you self-conscious about it when you're walking in quiet places (or perhaps anywhere). To me, this is the biggest drawback of the shoes, although I have only worn them for on and off for about a month so the squeak may subside (doubtful though). I also want to point out that these shoes are not 5 stars worthy for comfort. People need to be more realistic. These shoes have almost no cushioning and feel stiff. You can get used to it, but you will almost certainly prefer an ordinary other pair of sneakers. It's not like you have Swedish memory foam on your feet. If you want something similar and more comfortable, go with the Vans Bali. I bought the all black ones and like every bit of their appearance except for the white logo in back. I actually took a paintbrush and painted over it. The fact that these are slip-ons is efficient and you can whip them out in a moment's notice to runs errands, go to the bank, whatever...although I wouldn't wear these on a regular basis and definitely not for lots of walking. I ran for a few seconds in them and they felt very clunky. These shoes run large and I found a half size smaller to work fine.
These are nice shoes. They are great for casual wear. The size works with either very thin or no socks. If you plan to wear thick socks ordering your regular size may not work out. They are a great value.
