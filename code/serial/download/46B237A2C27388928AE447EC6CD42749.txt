KORS Michael Kors Kids Frannie (Toddler/Youth)
I love these sneakers, they appear to be well made. I think we may get the entire summer out of them because the toe box is patent leather. They should be easy to clean. My only complaint is they run wide, in my opinion really wide. I am going down a size, I don't have the option of a half size but even then I would have opted for the entire size down. The flowers are stitched on well. I hope the smaller size works because my four year was thrilled with her very girlie sneakers.
