pediped Jake Flex (Infant/Toddler)
Stylish, easy to put on and take off. I love the Flex system which includes an insole so you can get a slightly larger size without sacrificing fit or safety.
My son wore these when he was 3 -- and they were his absolute favorite pair of shoes. We just ordered them again, and although he's a much bigger boy (he's 5 and wearing a size 29) they are yet again his favorite pair. I love them, too -- as they fit well, clean up easily, and work with both casual and more dressed up attire.
My son has grown out of several pairs of Pedipeds and I just buy the next size and he loves them!  My younger son is wearing the originals which keep his foot protected as well as providing the flexibility he needs as a new walker.  
My 2.5 yo loves these shoes. They are soft and comfy and seemingly true to size. His foot is wide, and these shoes fit even with thicker socks. He tells me he likes to look like a 'big boy' with shoe laces, even though the shoes are actually slip on. He can get them on and off easily and by himself. Great looking shoe.
