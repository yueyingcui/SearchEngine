My son has gotten a lot of wear out of these shoes, they have worn very well.  They were expensive, but with the extra insert, they have survived through 2 shoe sizes in the past year. In the same time span, several pairs of his other shoes were outgrown. 

We live in Seattle, where it rains a whole lot and I did not seal the suede (as an earlier reviewer reported that she did) and it has not been a problem to the look or function of the shoe. They still look good after a full year of Seattle weather and plenty of puddle stomping.
