Vans Kids Authentic Core (Toddler/Youth)
Shipping was awesome, next day and free! Daughter loves these shoes. Got them a half size too big, but she can tie them tightly. She wants more colors now. 
I got these for my 12 year old daughter, and she loves them. She wears a 6-6.5 in adult sizes, and the youth 4 fits her perfectly. She got them in the gray color, which is nice and neutral and goes with lots of things. She says they are very comfortable, she has worn them several times, and she has never gotten blisters.
My three year old loves these shoes. They do run 1/2 size big. My son is a 10 1/2 so I ordered a 10 and they fit great. 
I absolutely love these shoes! They do run a bit big, so try half a size smaller.
My daughter loves these shoes. We have been Vans fans for several years. Just remember to order a size down as the Vans run a whole size (sometimes 1.5 times) big.
