Polo Ralph Lauren Faxon Low
This stylish sneaker caught my eye and I use it for casual day and some evening wear. The leather laces and trim are a nice touch.  I don't care for the extra large logo but it doesn't take away from the general look.  For me, it feels a half size too large and the liner is thin with no arch support.  I replaced the liner with an pair of beefed up liners that I had from a similar pair of Sperry sneakers.  Now, they are nice and coomfy.
Shoes are very comfortable. Runs a little big so maybe grab a half size smaller. Other than that shoes look great!
