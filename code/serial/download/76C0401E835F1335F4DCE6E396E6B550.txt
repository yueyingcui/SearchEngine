I bought these shoes for a hike in the Grand Canyon. I compared them to two (2) other styles and picked this one for (a) comfort and (b) size-ability. I will explain: the lacing and fit of these shoes is adjustable and great for hiking... as the day wears on, you can adjust the fit of the shoe by tying it looser or tighter; it has the room to shrink or grow and still fits well without a lot of wiggle on slopes. A great shoe, great traction, light!, and warm. Brilliant.
