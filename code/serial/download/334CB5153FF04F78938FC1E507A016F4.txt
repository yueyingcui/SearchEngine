Propet Tour Walker
These shoes are comfortable, and work well with my orthotics. They also seem to be true to size -- I wear a women's 12 and they fit. I've worn them only a couple of times, so this is just an initial impression. My only regret -- I didn't pay attention and bought shoes with Velcro instead of ties!
Love them. Had to exchange for 1/2 size larger. They run a little small if you wear heavy socks so plan on that. But fit good, feel good.
Shoes are comfortable (I have had several surgeries on knees and hips) and they look great. They do run large and I suggest going down a half size. I like them so much that I am not going to take a chance on returning for a smaller size. I will use inserts to tighten them up on my feet.
