PF Flyers Kids Center Hi (Toddler/Youth)
These are a deluxe shoe without the high price.  The materials are top quality, which you don't often see in a child's shoe.  The laces are soft, made of high weight combed cotton.  All the details of the design are scaled appropriately so it looks right, even in small size.  Overall, the shoe is a 'steal' for the price!
Bought these for my 8 year-old son who plays little league and is a huge fan of the "Sandlot" movie. He is thrilled! I cannot say much about the fit as he needs a wide shoe and they are very difficult to find so we buy a size larger. But it does seem to have arch support.
