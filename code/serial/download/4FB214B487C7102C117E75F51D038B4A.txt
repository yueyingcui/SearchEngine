Globe Encore
A very nice shoe, a very well made shoe. True to size. Very few size 14 shoes are available, this one is available in a 14. Can't go wrong! Good price.
Shoes feel true to size. Very comfortable & stylish. Some what difficult to maintain clean since they're canvas material. Also, great grip and feel once you're on a skateboard. Overall great shoes when it comes to anything urban.
Awesome kicks! The color is a bit more maroon than they look on my screen, but I like that. I own three pairs of Globes and they are all a bit smaller than "normal" sizing, but I knew that and got them a size bigger. All in all very happy with these shoes. The footbed is a little stiff, but my guess is that they'll break in.
Great pair of shoes. I got them for my grandson and he said they fit to size and are very comfortable.

I've bought him others of this brand and being a teen they never got worn out before his foot grew in size. 
Nice looking shoes. Runs a size big so we will hold onto them until his feet grow a little more.
They have had any product I have been looking for at the best price. Shipping faster than I expected and very helpful with a return for size. Would shop here anytime.
These shoes worked great. I got the rainbow ones. There very trippy. I get a lot of comments on them. They are great to fit. True to size.
The size and width are perfect. The look and quality is stylish and tough. They have a classic look to them which I love. The only thing that really lacks is the padding and arch support. If you are at a concert or standing/moshing for a few hours. Your feet get tired due to the lack padding/cushion. Same goes for bmx and skating for hours. For chill shoes they would be great. Buy them for the style and you will be happy.
Cool Shoe - 
Bought this for my son, he said it was just a little too small. I am not sure if maybe his foot has grown or if the shoe runs 1/2 size small. Other than that, he loves the style.
