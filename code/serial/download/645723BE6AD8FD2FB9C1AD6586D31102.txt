ECCO Sky Tie
These felt like home the instant I put them on. I haven't worn them out of the house yet, but I have no reason to believe they won't remain comfy. Eccos seem to work for me in size and comfort. I've had a pair of weather-proof flat walking/hiking boots for years, and they fit perfectly, too...and are still going strong. I'm a perfect 10.5 with a fairly narrow foot, and the 42's consistently fit. What I also like from the Eccos is that even their size 42 looks trim and sleek. Efficient use of material to support and comfort feet. Eccos are worth the cost for me.
I wanted a gray shoe to wear with pants. I love Ecco shoes and have several pair, as I have found them to be the epitome of comfort and durability, and they're nice looking too. The Ecco Sky Tie is well-made, but not as comfortable as my other Ecco shoes. Because I wear a size 9 and have thin legs, I look for shoes that minimize. Unfortunately, these do not.
Nice shoe!  I needed a new shoe for my job and this looked perfect.  Not only does it work well for work but you can wear it with casual clothes.  It can easily pass as a dressy shoe as well.  Goes with any style of pants...khakis, denim, etc.  Fits well.  Took a few days to adjust since these are narrow shoes but after that, they fit great!  They are true to size.  You'll be pleased with these shoes!
I usually wear a size 9, so these are a little roomy, but fine and comfortable.  I wore them for long days on a trip to Spain and they were great.  They are very light, I just wish they were more stylish.
