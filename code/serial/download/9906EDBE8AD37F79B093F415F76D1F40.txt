Vivobarefoot Evo II
These are the best barefoot shoes you can buy if you have size 16 feet.  The 49 is accurate to size, and very comfortable.  I use these for lots of exercise, including trail running, climbing, running, walking, weightlifting, and many more.
Best barefoot shoe - I tried out of New Balance MW01, New Balance MR1400, and inov-8 F-lite 195. This shoe ran about a half size large. I usually wear a 7.5 to 8 but comfortably fit in a 7. Only one minor hot spot on my left toe but chalking that up to a break in period. Large toe box makes this shoe a clear winner over the rest.
