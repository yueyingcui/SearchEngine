School Issue Varsity (Toddler/Youth)
I love saddle shoes with my daughter's uniform! Fit is good - true to size. Didn't hurt her feet at all, very comfortable.
I absolutely love these classic shoes! I bought them for my son. They are very well made and sturdy. I ordered them in my sons size, a 3, but they were about a half size too big. I decided to keep the 3 and just used some pads, but definitely something to keep in mind if ordering.
Such a handsome shoe, true to size, well made and both my 5 and 6 year old boys run around in them like they have sneakers on.  I have had this brand for several seasons and will keep buying til my kids think they are too cool for saddle shoes!
Purchased these shoes for my son for school, though he only wears them one day a week, when they wear the more formal uniform. The white part seems to resist scuffing, they look great. No complaints about comfort and the size was true. I measured his foot and ordered based on the measurements. I expect them to hold up well enough for his younger brother to wear!
