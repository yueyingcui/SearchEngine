New Balance MW910
Very comfortable shoe. Replaced a New Balance shoe with this one because they had updated it. One thing though, they run a little small. So you should order a full size up on these.
New Balance MW910 at size 7.5 2E was shorter than 4 other New Balance 7.5 shoes that I own.  My big toes touched the shoe front.
