Sperry Top-Sider Billfish Slip On
Very attractive "casual" shoe, very comfortable too, according to my husband. These shoes were supposed to be for "play," but he started wearing them to work immediately, they were so comfortable, and I might have to purchase another pair! I took the advice of other shoppers and ordered 1/2 size smaller than his usual size.
Had to return original pair because size 10 was larger than normal; re-ordered size 9 1/2 and they are fine.
I bought these for my college son. He loved the laced version and finds these equally comfortable. They are very durable as well. Returned the 11 for a size 10.5 due to the slip on nature, which made them looser than the same shoe with laces.

My son loved these shoes. They look great and are very comfortable. Had to go down 1/2 size to be able to wear these without socks.
Comfortable, easy to put on, look great, good grip on boat. I normally wear a size 10 to 12; but needed a 10 for these for a proper barefoot fit. The inner sole near the toes on one shoe is starting to slip out sometimes when I take the shoe off, but no other issues. I would definitely buy them again.
Shoes were a 1/2 size off. I ordered 11 1/2 and they were too big so I returned for 11. Very comfortable shoe, I wear w/o socks and they feel great.
