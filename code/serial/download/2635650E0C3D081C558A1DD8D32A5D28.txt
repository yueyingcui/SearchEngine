PUMA Soleil FS Wn's
I also ordered the Puma slip on sport shoe, love it! This one, however, fits a half size larger so there is too much room in the toe area.
Very cute and die comfortable. A little narrow but, fit very true to Puma size.
I love these shoes! Comfy, after about 8-10 hours of wear, the ball of my foot feels a bit tender. Looks cute with jeans...would've liked a better set of shoe laces. Fit was great, but get it 1/2 size smaller. Overall, a good shoe for walking the town.
