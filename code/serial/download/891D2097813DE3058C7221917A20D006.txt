Nike Eclipse II
Love these! I usually wear a size 6, but listened to other reviews and ordered a 6.5 and they fit perfectly.
I ordered a half-size up, so the 9 fit my 8.5 size perfectly.  However, these have no cushioning so I am sending them back and plan to order the gel Asics.
Super comfy, aerobic or every day walking shoes.  Cool looking too.  My only gripe is going to me spinning class in these.  Somehow the soles must be a little thin so pressing down on the pedal is a little uncomfortable.  I would imagine then, they wouldn't be great for small hikes and such, uneven ground, etc.  Also, ordered a half size larger as I usually do with sneakers and that worked out great.
I like these shoes because they are light weight and they have a good arch support. I usually wear a size 8, but and 8 1/2 feels better.
