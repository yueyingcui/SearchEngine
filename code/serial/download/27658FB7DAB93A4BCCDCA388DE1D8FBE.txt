Nike Overplay VI
I bought these shoes for extra support during my Zumba class. In women's shoes I wear 11/11.5, so I ordered these in men's size 9.5 They were too small, so I re-ordered them in a 10. I just barely fit them. So do order them in a size a little bigger than you normally wear. Also, I have a very narrow foot (AA). I found these shoes to be slightly narrow, which is good for me. Not so good if you have a wide foot. Overall, I really like these shoes.
I have been very happy with these shoes. I have wider feet so ordered EE size, and have been happy with the fit and comfort. They provide a lot of angle support, which I also like although the angle sides make them harder to put on without really loosening the laces a lot.
These fit great and are true to size. However the toes and sole starting separating after only two weeks of normal use.
