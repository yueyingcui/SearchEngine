New Balance MK706
Had to order 1/2 size bigger and wider than normal.  Not quite the arch support I was hoping for.
Very comfortable shoes. I needed a pair of dark, non-descript shoes since my white sneakers were too unprofessional. They did run a little large for me I usually wear a size 12 wide, but size 12 wide of these were too large and made a "flop" noise when I walk. Leather was a little squeaky, but not terrible.
I bought these shoes for my husband.  We had to reorder to get a half size larger.  When they arrived he wore these shoes for almost two weeks staight before changing.  No breaking in.
This is an excellent shoe for my wide feet.  True to size and width.  I wear them all the time--feel great with excellent arch support.
