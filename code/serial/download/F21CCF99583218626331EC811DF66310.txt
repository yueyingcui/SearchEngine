Nike Kids Advantage Runner (Infant/Toddler)
Cute, comfortable and perfect for kids with wide feet! We have gotten these shoes in several sizes because they work so well for our toddler. 
These are my son's third pair of Nike's. He is 16 months old and changes sizes quickly. He seems to walk/run well in them. 
This is the second pair of Nike Kids Advantage Runner shoes I have bought for my twin boys. They are durable, clean easily, well soled, and long lasting (until they grow out of them). Double knot the laces for safety. The width is average and true to size. I've bought white twice and am very happy with them.

Love these shoes--we have bought them twice now in two different sizes. Very cute, goes with everything, and the laces are long enough to double knot and stay tied. 

Our little guy has size 4, wide feet, and these fit wonderfully in a 4W. He runs around in them well.  There is a little loop on the back of the shoe to help the parent pull the shoe onto the foot, which is a nice touch.  I recommend double-knotting the laces, especially if your child likes to untie their shoes. 
Perfect size, fit, and flexibility. Shoe laces are a perfect length, which has been a problem in the past.

True to size. Super cute, well made. Love them and so does my daughter.
Very cute sneakers that are getting my son a lot of compliments.I ordered them half a size larger than his real size but he's walking around in them comfortably as you can tighten them securely with the laces.
These shoes are true to size and I love the support they give my 22 month old. I don't buy anything but Nike for my boys because of the great support they give their feet. They are light which is also great for new walkers. They appear to be easy to walk in as my son walks and runs in the every time he puts them on with very few stumbles. I highly recommend them.
