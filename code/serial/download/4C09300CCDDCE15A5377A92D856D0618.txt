Montrail Fairhavenâ„¢
Bloody heel best describes the experience. This is my 5th pair of Montrails and by far the worst running shoe ever. Previously I have owned the Continental Divide (fantastic), Hard Rock (so-so), and 2 pairs of Vitesse (they never die). I figured a new pair of running shoes would be a no brainer. I am a mixed trail and surface runner and have always had a favorable experience with this brand. What gives? What non-runner designed the Achilles support area so unforgiving that his has made my feet bleed. The shoe is the right size, but the back has sharp edges that dig into the backs of your feet. Do not purchase.
