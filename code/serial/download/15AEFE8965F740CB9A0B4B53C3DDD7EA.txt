Vans 106 Vulcanized Core Classics
I ordered these for my son. He was looking for a pair of simple all-black classic sneakers. He says they are comfortable and true to size.
I was looking to change it up from Chucks and these are killer! No stiffness or new shoe break-in to worry about. The first wear feels like the 200th wear comfort-wise and they are very true to size. Also, they look good with everything. Vans never disappoint with perfect, casual, anytime rock-it-out kicks!
Hate to be a bummer but I wear a size 13 (us) and this shoe fit me terribly, it felt more like a 12 than a 13. I lined it up next to my last pair of comparable Vans and they were visibly smaller. It was tight in the toe and cramped my foot up all day. I wore them for a few days trying to break them in but gave up after it became too much. This might have been a fluke but I wasn't stoked.
I love these shoes.  They felt great right out of the box.  The women's 5.5 was true to size.  So happy to find them in my size.  I love the thick sole, style, and feel.
I bought these shoes for my boyfriend. He has been looking for them for months, but I knew where to get them. He tore open the box and tried them on and they fit. These shoes are true to the size and very comfortable. It is just like getting them from the store without ever leaving your house!
