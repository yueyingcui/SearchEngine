New Balance WW928
I've been wearing the 927's for several years now after multiple foot surgeries. It was the one "normal" shoe I could wear outside of orthopedic shoes. Like others, I don't know why New Balance changed what was a very good thing. If it works, don't change it. I ordered the 928, received promptly, and tried them on last night. They fit, but they really feel different and the heel seems to be a bit wider than the same size in the 927. I do not think they are as nice as the 927 style, seem more cheaply made, less seams, and the entire heel feels different. New Balance...stop changing what works for people. Bring back the 927.
