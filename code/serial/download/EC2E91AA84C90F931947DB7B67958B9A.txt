Tsukihoshi Kids Phoenix (Youth)
My son loves these and calls these his Iron Man shoes. :-) Despite also having the Tsukihoshi Speed in navy/white and black, he wears his Iron Man shoes the most. The black rubber toe protector piece is a little loose on one shoe, but otherwise they've held up pretty well for almost daily wear. For comparison purposes, Tsukihoshi runs about a 1/2 larger than regular shoes, so do not size up. Also this particular style is a little more stiff than the Speed, so it did require a little breaking in for my son. Since we found this brand, we've never gone back to buying from that kids shoes store in the mall.
Love these shoes.  We bought them in the red and gold, thought they would be loud but they are so cool looking.  My son loves them. Definitely order a half size down. My son is a size 2 it was way to big for him. We then ordered 1 1/2 and they fit perfectly. Oh and they are soo light too which it nice. I just hope they last.
These are about the only shoes I buy for my son. They open wide when you are putting them on so they are easy on and off for a 4 year old. They hold up well and can go in the washing machine. They run a bit big so don't size up.

The sizing on this brand is not easy. One size too big and the next one down too small. Could not keep either one.
My son loves these shoes. Super light weight, easy on and off. Nice and roomy in the width. Order 1/2 size down if you have not tried this brand before. All 3 of my kids wear Tsukihoshi's. They have requested and tried some of the trendy brands they see on TV but if you look at their feet, the Tsukishoshi shoes are the favorites.
My son loves these shoes. However, we decided to set them aside until his feet grow just a bit more and order a smaller size. Suggest you order at least a half size smaller than usually wear.
