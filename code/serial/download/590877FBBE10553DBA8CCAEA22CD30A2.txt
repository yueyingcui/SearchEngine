Osiris NYC83 Low W
Overall really fly looking shoe...I love the houndstooth and the hidden hot-pink sole. I bought this shoe because I wanted something unique, and I love them! I have flat feet so I have to wear insoles anyways, but without my insoles they have almost no arch support, except for the "inner arch" area, which has moderate support. Like most skate shoes, they have lots of padding and insulation, making them really comfortable. I read that these shoes tend to run large, so I ordered a 1/2 size small and they're perfect with even a little room to spare.
I ordered the grey/pink/white. This will be my third pair of Osiris shoes. They fit well and are a good size.
