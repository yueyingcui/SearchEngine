I have a wide foot, ordered one size up and they fit perfectly. The sole wore out after 6 months though. I don't skate, just wore them as my daily shoes. No complaints other than that.
These shoes rock. They are stylish, true to size, and very comfortable. If you're looking for a lot of padding, look elsewhere, but they do have good arch support.

I bought these for my son and he loves them. True to size and very comfortable.
