Reef Deck Hand 2
Size 10 of theses is about the same as a Nike size 10, little bit bigger than Adidas size 10. Pretty much the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn, because of the insoles in them. I've been looking for replacement insoles online, in case the shoes start to smell, but haven't been able to find them. Hopefully they'll come out with some.
These are pretty cool shoes. They are true to size and comfortable after you break them in, which only takes a couple of days. I wish that the blue lining was more visible, as you cannot really see it with the shoes on.
Great shoes at a great price. Very comfortable fit -- I normally wear 11 1/2, purchased size 12, perfect. My wife loves them, and they brought an unsolicited compliment from a friend's wife!
The most comfortable shoes I own. I usually wear Onitsuka Ultimate 81s and have for years, but these are my new favorite. I got them in brown also, and they look nice enough for casual events. I absolutely love these shoes and recommend them to anyone who will listen. I usually wear a size 9.5, but the 10s fit perfectly. Also good arch support for a canvas shoe, much better than the Vans.
