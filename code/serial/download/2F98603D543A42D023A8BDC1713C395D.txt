ASICS GEL-Ilyeo IIâ„¢
These shoes are incredibly comfortable and lightweight. Perfect for dancing or zumba. The size was good and the other reviews were helpful in deciding.
I love these shoes! They are light, comfortable, and perfect for Zumba. I am an older (65) Zumba-er, so good support in a light shoe is important to me. So glad I got these shoes! They do run half a size small, so plan accordingly.
Going by other reviews I ordered a half size larger. Glad I did. Good fit, although I found I like them only for aerobics.

These shoes are super cute and incredibly comfortable! I bought half a size larger (thanks to the advice from other reviewers) and they fit perfectly.
Great looking shoes. Very narrow, snug glove-like fit (which you'll either like or not). For me, these were definitely a half-size too small. (I'm an 8 at most and I kept the 8.5.)
These shoes are light weight and comfy althought they run a 1/2 size small so I had to send the first pair back.  They're great for activities such as Zumba, Pilates, Yoga etc.  but forget the long walks!  I love them, glad I bought them but use them selectively.
