ASICS GEL-1140Vâ„¢
This is a very comfortable shoe with great support and the right amount of toe room for my size 12 feet. Most athletic shoes fail in that one area. I love the black and purple colors but I don't like the camouflage accent, I have discovered, after trying them on. I'm going to return them for a different pair of Asics.
