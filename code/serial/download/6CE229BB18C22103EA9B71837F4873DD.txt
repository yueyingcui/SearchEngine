Ashworth Cardiff      
I have a narrow foot width and bought these mostly for their fit at a reasonable price.  The shoes fit well in width without over-tightening the laces for my "A" width size requirement. I also walk most courses and found the shoes acceptable for walking nine holes and did this several times to break them in.  However, the first time I walked 18 was a disaster with blisters on both my heals that began after about 12-holes.  I am sure the design contributed to this result.  I would not recommend the shoes for walkers.
Great looking shoe, but the size was totally wrong, I've never worn a 9 1/2 size shoe but that is what I will have to exchange it for in this brand.
Great style. But they run small. I had to bring them back to shop for a half size larger after playing 3 uncomfortable rounds in them. Much better now.
I love these shoes! They are very comfortable, look good, and are versatile. I have worn them for about 10 rounds of golf both walking and not, they keep my feet dry and do not slip. Plus I can wear them to and from the course. I also own the Ecco Street and like the Cardiff better. Some have said that the size runs small, I did not find this.
I just wish they made a size "wide" in this shoe. Feels great, looks great, but not quite wide enough. Thank you!
