I love these shoes, but I feel tricked. When they arrived, they fit perfectly, like outdoor slippers. But after wearing them for a day, something happened, they started to shape shift or shrink inside somehow, and now my toes all rub against the edges to the extent that I can't even wear them anymore. Money down the drain. If you buy these, buy them a full size larger than you're used to, or you'll be sorry after a few days wear.
Great shoe. Looks good and feels good. Literally feels as if I am wearing slippers. I prefer to keep these shoes on when hanging around the house rather than going barefoot. Cozy and comfortable. After wearing these a couple of days I will never wear anything else. The shoe itself is expertly designed. It slips on an off easily and sits very low on the foot itself. This is what gives it the barefoot feel. Your foot has the entire range of motion as if you were shoeless. Worth the extra money for sure. My only complaint is that the sole is so thin (although they claim it is puncture resistant) that you will notice stepping on something jagged verses a shoe with a normal sole. I am curious as to how long the sole will hold up under normal walking conditions as I walk to work about 1.5 miles both ways. These shoes are so comfortable you will literally not want to take them off. Great investment and work casual, finally! If you are in between sizes, order the next size up and you will have the perfect fit.
