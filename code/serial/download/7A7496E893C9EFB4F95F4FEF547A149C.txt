J-41 Paragon
Loved this shoe, but returning for a larger size. Nice cushioning, good arch support (but soft, which I actually liked), interesting design; I hope the 1/2 size up works. Fun shoe.
I truly love these shoes. They're true to size; fit comfortably and are so unique in  style.  People stop me in the street to compliment my shoes. I now have seven pairs in various colors.
