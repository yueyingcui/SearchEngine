PUMA Avila Mid Wn's
This is a fun shoe in appearance...but overall comfort was lacking. Shoe is true to size, but after an hour or two around town...my feet were incredibly sore! This was a surprise since the leather felt and appeared to be soft. May need to invest some mileage in this shoes till they are broken in. Overall style...super fresh, especially after I switched out the white laces for black ones. Works well with black skinny jeans. Overall comfort...lacking.
