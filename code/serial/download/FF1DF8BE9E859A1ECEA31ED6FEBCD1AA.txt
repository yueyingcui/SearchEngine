ASICS Kids Pre-Havocâ„¢ PS (Toddler/Youth)
I got these shoes for my 5 year old and 6 year old boys. They fit true to size and provided excellent arch support. The are brightly colored and even the grey stands out more than expected.
Great shoe. It looks good and according to my son is very fast. Shoe strings stay tied and shoe fits to size. I would purchase it again.
