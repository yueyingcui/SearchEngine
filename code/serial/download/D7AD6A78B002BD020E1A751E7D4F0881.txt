Keds Kids Original Champion CVO (Youth)
Great shoe and durable. It does seem to run 1/2 to a whole size larger than my child would normally wear (i.e. 3 in Keds would be 3.5 or 4 in other brands).
We got this shoe for a summer camp musical theater production. Great for an inexpensive shoe that could be dyed. However, it is a 1/2-size to 1 full size bigger how other shoes fit my child.
Keds ran true to size, made do durable leather. They are a flat shoe shoe. Great buy.
Great shoe - 
I bought this shoe for my 9 year old daughter. They fit true to size and are practical and go with everything. She is very picky and loves them. The fact that they are leather makes them easy to keep clean.
