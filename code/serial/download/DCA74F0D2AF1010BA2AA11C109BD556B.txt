adidas Originals Superstar 2
These shoes are nice looking. However, the quality is terrible. First of all they are sized way too narrow. The toe box is tight and these shoes are tight through out the entire shoe. they are not worth the money. The insoles are thin and glued into place. The soles are thin and flexible.
A little larger than expected, length-wise. If you're used to NB sizing I'd go a half size smaller. Other than that, this shoe never goes out of style.
Took 3 tries to get the right fit, since these are sized for men. I'm normally about a 6.5 women's, so I got the corresponding men's size, too big. Went down to 5.5 womens, too big. Finally got it with a women's 4.5. Just assume if you're a woman that you're going to need a size or 2 smaller than you usually wear. Other than that, shoes look and feel good!
Shoe runs about a half size large but overall is very comfortable.  Will probably get same in another color.
Love these shoes, have them in three different style combinations.  I'm a grown woman, and I think they look great.  I ultimately purchased them in 1.5 sizes smaller though, since the sizing is unisex.
Great looking sneakers. Run a half size smaller for me so had to buy 10.5.
My daughter bought this shoe last year in another color.  The comfort level is good, but the size does run a bit big.  It's a bit of a bulky shoe, too.
I was looking for a great price on these and I found the best price here. The shoes fit perfect and they look great. I used the men's size from my other black and white adidas and it worked out awesome! Also, I thought it would be like a week before I received them, but it was only 4 days.
