New Balance WW860
This is a great walker. I was looking for a shoe that would provide comfort and stability after breaking my foot and this shoe provided both. It is also a good neutral color. I always order my New Balance a full size larger so it fit perfectly.
New Balance shoes are always a good fit for me. I wear a size 5, which can be rather difficult to find in styles I like. The rigid sole, firm innersole, soft woven upper, and cushioned support provide comfort for walking and other activities. I love these shoes!
These are comfortable!  They felt true to size, perhaps a tad roomy at first, but I know a half size smaller would have been too tight.  I'm a fast walker and I'm pleased with how they feel on my feet.  The only drawback I see is the shoe laces are a bit short when they're tied to every hole.
