Nike Action Zoom Mogan 2
I have been wearing nike 6.0's for the past few years and they have been great.  However, I think nike changed their sizing model because these shoes are too narrow.  I normally wear a size 9 and I upsized to a size 10 and they were still too narrow.
Overall these are nice shoes. They are a little bit more oversized than my normal size.

Great alternative to cool DC skateboard sneakers. Nice thicker material so holds up better in weather & also with active boys. Nike usually sun 1/2 size small but this model true to size. Great color looks good with jeans. Funky fun design on heel. Discreet yet some flair.
