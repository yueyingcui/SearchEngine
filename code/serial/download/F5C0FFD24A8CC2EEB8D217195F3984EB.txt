Vans E-Street
Decent shoe. I felt that these shoes were true to my size if I wore them without socks. I plan on getting some thin, very low cut socks so I don't have to go bare foot in the shoe all the time. Removing the insole does make it easier to wear socks but you lose the comfort. I think that the color in the photo is a tad bit deceiving as the shoe seems a few shades darker than what is pictured. 
My favorite Vans model ever. Runs true to size. You'll definitely want to replace the insole as they have absolutely no arch support. I use these as my everyday shoe and they have held up really well. At first they'll be tight but once you break them in they're like butter. I will be buying more for sure.
They are very comfortable, but they are not true to there size. I originally ordered a size 12 but they were way too big. I got an 11.5 and they are still big but not terribly. I recommend getting a whole size smaller.
I got these shoes in black a half size smaller than what I normally wear (because I intended to wear them without socks). They're very comfortable and look good. You won't be disappointed.
These shoes are real comfy and look super casual. I ordered them a 1/2 size smaller than I would normally because I think you're supposed to wear them with no socks. Just know if you do that they will smell really bad pretty soon. But who cares. The insole comes out easy and I'm sure you can probably buy a replacement insole if needed. Comfy and casual.
