New Balance WT20v2
I absolutely love these. I don't know what others don't like about them! They're not stiff at all. Perhaps I got a weird pair? I don't know, but I do know that I love these. I got the pink pair. They do take some getting used to if you're not used to running in a minimal shoe. I wasn't, and it took me about a month to like them. I knew I would if I gave them a chance and I am glad I did! It really helps you get a mid-foot strike if you are like me and really hit hard with your heels. It's not as supportive, but once you 're used to that, it's really not a big deal. I travel a lot and these are so small and light - they're perfect for travelers. I have wide feet also and these come in a wide! Thank God! They're great. They do run a tad large to me, so I went 1/2 size down.
I did not care for these shoes. I felt the seams or something under my arches, and when I flexed my feet, the fabric in the front of the shoes felt crackly and resistant. It is possible that the shoes were just too wide at that point for me (size 10W, which is my normal New Balance shoe size). I pronate, so that is part of the issue with the way the arches feel. These shoes did feel the lightest of the three brands that I tried, though.
I wear the NB 20 v1; I ordered the NB 20 v2 - too big. I had to order 1 full size smaller. Material is stiff; does not have the barefoot feel at all. I will stick with the NB 20 v1 or if I have to - NB 10.
The shoe was about a size larger than normal. The sole was hard to bend. I love the color, not the shoe.
