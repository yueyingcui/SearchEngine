Propet Travel Walker II
These are terrific sneakers. I got them before a vacation and wore them immediately -- no "break in" needed. Comfortable, light-weight, flexible, just the right amount of cushioning. This is my second pair of travel walkers -- and I'm sold. Will buy more colors as available in my size.
These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.  I ordered them in 5 different colors, and I wear them everywhere. Sometimes, it's hard to find them in my size because they sell out quickly.  If you see them in your size, buy them immediately.  You'll be glad you did.
I bought this shoe in black for an indoor balance class. I like that it is light and thin, so I feel what I'm doing during the exercises. I only wear the shoes indoors, I carry them in with me if it's raining. The perforation is wonderful for keeping my feet cool, but not good for wet weather. I would think that if they were comfortable for walking, the lightness of the shoe and the perforation would make them great for summer. I don't wear them except for class, because there is very little arch support. They run a little small for Propet, but they work fine in a half size larger. My feet are a bit between sizes anyway. I have a WW and it's nice and wide for my foot. I've had no trouble with the little toggle tie, I like it. I have a pair of this style shoe in red suede and they have more arch support, but still not enough to make them wearable for more than the class time. I also have a pair of red suede shoes in this style and they have more arch support. I was hoping Propet would made these shoes with better support for this summer.
