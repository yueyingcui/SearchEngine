These shoes are very cute in person, and I am delighted to finally find comfortable shoes that do not ride off my heels every time I walk (I have very narrow heels), yet they stretch a bit to accommodate my bunion. Remember that when making your purchase and consider buying half a size larger if you do not have narrow feet. I have the brown pair, but it is more of a muted purple, and (surprisingly) it goes with everything. I gave it a four star overall rating because the inserts come out every time I take the shoes off.
I really like the style of these shoes; light weight and casual, but nicer than sneakers. I have wide feet, and had to order a half size larger, even to be worn without socks.
