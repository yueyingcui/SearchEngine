Rieker D8903 Dena 03
I purchased both colors and the darker brown color seems to run a half size short, the upper leather is so cute, the outer sole is hard not a comfort sole and little comfort inside. I still like the shoe and may keep the white one but will return the brown and try another style. I love Rieker shoes and I am suprised at this shoe which I had expected to feel just as comfortable as my other Riekers. I bought the size 40 which is the typical size I wear but in the brown that felt more like an 8.5 than a 9 so if you buy a size 40 and wear an 8.5 then it may work for you, if you really need a size 9-9.5 I would try the size 41.  They are nice looking shoe, but not as comfortable as I need with some foot issues in one foot. 
These are super cute, but the size was too small and the soles are way too hard. Like walking on concrete. The upper portion near the heel also cut into my ankle area.
