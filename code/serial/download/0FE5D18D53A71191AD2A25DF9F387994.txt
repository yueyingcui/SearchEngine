Nike Zoom Elite+
I've been buying Nike running shoes for 30 years or more for the simple reason that they fit. I can feel comfortable ordering a size 11 online because I am confident that they will be the right size when they arrive.

These shoes are light and appear to provide good support. I've got around 30 miles in on them without problems.

And my wife says she can see me about a half mile away. They are definitely the orange-est shoes I have owned!
