Orthaheel Kate Walker
I have friends who love this brand of shoe and swear it helps alleviate their heel pain. I ordered this walker for that reason, and because I thought the style was nicer for everyday running around than a standard clunky walking shoe. The style is cute and sporty. They do run short you should order a half size larger to accommodate a sock. My foot is not wide, but they also run a bit narrow. The arch support is good, however they do not provide the support of most walking shoes. I found that my foot rolled over when walking, which is something this brand claims to correct. There is little to no cushioning in the ball of the foot area. I sometimes have a problem with a Morton's neuroma, and it acted up within 10 minutes of wearing these around the house. I guess for now I will stick with Merrill clogs for running around and my ugly white clunky walking shoes for serious walking. I was very disappointed in this shoe and found it no better than a much cheaper pair of run of the mill tennis shoes.
