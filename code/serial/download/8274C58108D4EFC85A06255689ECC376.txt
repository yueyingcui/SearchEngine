These shoes are like the ones you find in the back of your closet that have been missing for about 20 years (I know, who does not clean their closet for 20 years? Me). You put them on and you are reunited with your best friend who you haven't seen in, well, 20 years. Seriously, instant comfort and I predict your new favs. I ordered a half size larger because of availability, and they are perfect.
