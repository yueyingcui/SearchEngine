Nike Nike Shox Roadster+
I really like Nike Shox and have two other pairs. This one, however, seemed a little tighter than the others and even though it is the correct size I felt it was overall smaller than previous versions of the same shoe.
I wanted to love these shoes. The stability, response, and arch support are great. But as other reviewers wrote, these shoes fit very tightly. So tight that after 15 minutes of wear around my house, my feet were tingly, almost asleep. Loosening the laces did not help. Going up a half size didn't help. Too bad. As a side note, I also think these shoes look big and clunky. However, I could have ignored that if the fit was right.
