Merrell Kids Skyjumper MJ (Toddler/Youth)
Bought these for both my daughters (different ages/sizes) - had to return them both, as they were quite a bit larger and wider than their measured size, even though I had measured their feet prior to ordering. Also, my daughter felt that the area of the instep under the strap dug into her arch at that point (despite being too wide elsewhere).
This is a very cute, well-made shoe...unfortunately we had to send it back. I ordered my daughter's correct show size and it's huge! At least one or two sizes too big! It would be at least another year+ before she could wear them! I don't know what size to even try. Too bad because they're so darn cute!
