etnies Kids Metal Mulisha Fader (Toddler/Youth)
I bought these shoes in size 10 for my 3 year old and he loves them! He refuses to wear anything but them. He even had his Santa pictures taken with them on. The tongue is very padded and the shoes laces stay tied great. These are wonderful, comfy, roomy shoes. Very true to size.
My son loves these shoes! He has received many compliments from his friends in school. He loves the attention that they get. They are true to size and made of excellent quality.
My 8-year-old LOVES them...
I ordered them a half size big, as skate shoes tend to run snug, and I was glad I did. My son loves the shoe for school and general running around the neighborhood, and thinks he looks cool doing it.

Shoes are great. They seem to run smaller than normal. I would suggest a half size bigger.

Good value, fast service on this shoe!
We tried on a pair of Etnies at the mall and we thought that the youth size 5 1/2 fit but when we got the shoes they seemed bigger so my son has too wait to grow a bit more because they are too large. Overall we like them and don't feel we need to return them for a smaller size. As we think he would quickly grow out of the size 5.
