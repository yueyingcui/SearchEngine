Nike Action Kids Avid Jr 6.0 (Toddler/Youth)
My son really liked these shoes.  They were the correct size for him.  We had to return them because his heel kept slipping.  This seems to be a problem with Nike shoes.  We will try another brand.
Great looking and comfortable shoes. My 4 year old loves them. The only problem we've encountered, is they are really a bear to get his foot in the shoe. We also ordered a full size larger than his shoe size, and I'm glad we did. Once we get the shoe 'on' he has plenty of room and he says they're great on his feet.
This shoe ran small.  My son has another pair of Nike 6.0 shoes and I ordered that same size.  This shoe seems narrower in the toe box than the pair we own, and I will order a whole size larger.
We bought size 7 for my 12 year old son. He likes these shoes the best of the ones I picked out and wears them every day - we are 3 months in now. He colored the white band at the bottom red because he didn't like the white - I agree - it looks better red. They are holding up very well, no extreme wear spots.
