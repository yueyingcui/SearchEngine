ASICS GEL-Precisionâ„¢ TR
I wear a size 10 EE and this shoe barely went on my foot.  It is smaller than marked and does not accomodate a deep footbed.
I wear a size 5-1/2  2E in New Balance. I have been searching for a replacement for my favorite WR769ST which has been discontinued. This was my first time trying Asics. My toes hit the front of the shoe in the 5-1/2. Length was okay in the size 6. The width was too narrow though, so will not be keeping either size of this shoe. The 2E width marked on this shoe feels more like a D width. I gave a one-star for comfort since I was unable to leave it blank. Since the shoe did not fit correctly, it was not comfortable. I got the Brooks Adrenaline GTS12 at the same time and the 5-1/2 2E fit well and will be keeping those.
