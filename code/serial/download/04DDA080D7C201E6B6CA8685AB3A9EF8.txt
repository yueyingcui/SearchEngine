adidas Samba® Millennium
Very nice looking runners.  They aren't the most comfortable runner, but acceptable for everyday casual wear.  The runners are narrow and seem to run small so I ordered a size up which fit perfect.
Good shoe so far.  Might have been able to get the the 1/2 size smaller, but that shoe had an issue with the left shoe.
Nice shoe, but order a full size up. Some reviews said to order 1/2 size up, so I did, and still too small. 
My dog has, over time, eaten all of my sneakers so it was time for a new pair. I am a girl and ordered a pair of Samba Millenniums and a pair of Samba Original Suedes. I am a women's size 9 and went back and forth about what size I should order but I ended up getting a 7½ in both. The Millenniums actually physically look a little longer but they seem to fit more narrow in the toe and feel a bit snug. I will have to break them in. The Originals seem wider in the toe and already fit great. Both are fine in length it is just the Millennium narrow toe that I am hoping will go away after a few wears because they feel like a better shoe. Millennium has more arch support but both are OK. The Originals do squeak on hard wood - this might stop after they get a little dirty? All in all I am a very happy buyer! Just reporting as I read helpful reviews which I used to make my decisions before buying. Now if I can just remember to keep the new kicks up and away from the pup when not on my feet! Otherwise, I will be back for more very soon.
Originally bought a size 12, as that is my normal shoe size. It was extremely tight and too short, so I would definitely recommend going up a half size with this shoe. The 12.5 worked out great.
Perfect. Xmas gift for my girlfriend, who is size 8 and a half womans, bought the size 9 (mans) and good fit. Classic styling plus updated arch support. She loves them. Little stiff to break in, but doing well after a couple weeks.
A definite improvement over the original Sambas (especially the tongue). It does require some breaking-in, though... pretty good traction, fairly decent arch support (finally!), but it does feel a bit narrow around the toe box so you may want to order half a size bigger if you have wide feet. Overall, this is the pair of shoes I turn to when I'm actually playing or when I'm just cruising around town. I would definitely buy again (unless there is a Samba 3 in the works!). Now, if Adidas would only make them in some more colors…

The Millennium Samba is not your normal Samba.  The tongue is short, the sole is not the same, and the sizes don't match other Sambas.  It is stylish, and I like the sole, but it is not the classic Samba that we all know and love.
This shoe has issues. First, the shoe is short and the toe box is very tight. Order half size up. Second, these shoes will squeak with every step you take as a result of your heel rubbing against the cheap, squeaky plastic. The uppers are made from Vietnamese plastic. They look and feel cheap. Everyone will comment on how squeaky your shoes are. Third, you will need to double-knot the laces as they do not stay tied for more than 5 minutes. Lastly, these are not performance/soccer shoes. They are stable, but feel like boats on your feet. Not for soccer at all. Fit, materials, laces, and performance all problematic. A squeaky, plastic lifestyle shoe at best.
Really wanted these to work as they look great and seem like they would be a little more supportive than most indoor soccer shoes but the fit will just not work for me, so am returning. Not sure about the reviews claiming these feel true to size and width as I have been a rock-solid 10 and average width in every pair of shoes I have bought in the past 10 years, but I can barely get my foot into these. They are very narrow and length wise I actually have space in front of my big toe but other toes feel crushed.
