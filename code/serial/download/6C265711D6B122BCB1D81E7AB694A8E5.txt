Twig Kids Cody II (Infant/Toddler)
I ordered this shoe because of the cute style and color, but most of all because of the commitment to the environment. I really wanted this shoe to work for my son. Unfortunately, the shoe is extremely short. When I say short, I mean its height (not length). Because it is short, the Velcro straps do not come all the way across the foot and stop about half-way across the foot, making the shoe look like it does not fit properly. The tongue is as wide as the sides and it does not stay nicely tucked in. These shoes will be returned. My son has a size 11 foot. It is not wide nor is it narrow. He is an average width.
