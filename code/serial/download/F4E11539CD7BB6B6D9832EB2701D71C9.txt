adidas Originals Campus 2 - Leather
While I loved the style, the arch felt very high compared to the Campus II SK's I normally wear. To boot, while the length of the shoe was perfect, the shoe was much narrower in the middle of the shoe than in the aforementioned shoes I generally wear. I'm at a loss since I can't find the version I'm accustomed to, and I don't want to order a full size or more bigger just to improve the fit for width.
