New Balance Kids KV624Y (Toddler/Youth)
We last bought New Balance shoes in an infant/toddler size at Sears (for a three year old), and the soles were thin and flimsy. Maybe it was a different style, but it looked the same. Anyway, we just got these in a size 10, and they are wonderful! They are built like adult New Balance shoes - sturdy, with good heel and arch support. They are deep enough for my five year old son's orthotic shoe inserts, although I might opt for a wide size next time to give him a little more room. They must be comfortable as he is picky about shoes, but he has never taken these shoes off without being told to.
Bought these for school for my son.  True to size, strong and sturdy. Will last the whole school year!
When you mail a size 2 shoe to a customer you are probably assuming it is being worn by a child. I have news for you! I am 86 years old and this is the size I wear. Your service is very convenient for me. When I was five years old I contracted polio so my feet grew little since then and finding shoes to fit has always been a problem. I have a local shoeman who adds a half inch platform extension to the outside of the left shoe. This keeps me walking easily. Now if you could find a solution to my balance problem I would be double happy.
