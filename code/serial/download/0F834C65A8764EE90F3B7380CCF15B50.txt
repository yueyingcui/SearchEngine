Keds Kids Daphne T-Strap Silver (Infant/Toddler)
I love these shoes. I have gotten the white ones for my daughter in two different sizes, and liked the silver in the next size for fall. They go with everything! My daughter does need a wide width in these when she usually does not need wide, so keep that in mind.
