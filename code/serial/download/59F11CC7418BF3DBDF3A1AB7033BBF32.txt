Saucony Grid Excursion TR6
Love this shoes, they are my 2nd pair. fit true to size, perfect replacement of the worn out pair!
Love the sneaker, very comfortable. However, I had to exchange for a larger size. Usually wear a size 7. Needed a 7.5.
So disappointed, this shoe runs small by at least 1/2 size and the medium is really narrow. I could barely get my orthotic in and that's after removing the insole. I'll be returning this. 
Great cushion walking, jogging shoe. Had to re-order half size larger. Arch support still not enough have to put orthodic in left shoe. 
Ordered them in a 7.5 wide, but they are not wide (New Balance and Clarks have a much wider "wide" size). Other than size issue they are good shoes, good support, seem to be well-made. I need to return them.
I love these shoes. Great fit. Great support for my feet. True to size. And I love the black color.
First timer with Saucony and it was love at first sight. Only thing is it felt a bit tight on my toe so I have to switch for 1/2 size up. I am 6m.
Ladies - Saucony's runners are the best for your feet. Running shoes are the lightest weight shoe and Saucony and Asics are the women's athletic shoes designed to fit women's feet. Others are men's shoes. That's why you often need a wide shoe and then your heel is slipping out while you walk. Take my podiatrist's advice. You don't need to break in these shoes because they fit your feet properly! Once you know your correct size you can depend on this brand fitting you regardless of the style.
