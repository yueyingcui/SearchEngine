New Balance Classics M574
The toe on these was too rounded for my taste. It was also a half size too small for what I normally wear. I ended up going with the NB 501's in the same size instead.
I use these as walking around shoes, and they work great. The wide size I bought doesn't provide as much extra width as, say, DCs, but they're definitely roomier than standard width shoes. They're extremely lightweight. The construction feels solid. The soles make these seem fairly tall, but that might be because I'm accustomed to skate shoes.
I purchased these shoes after trying several Nike shoes. The NB shoes seems to fit and feel much better. There was no break in period. I went back last week to order another pair, but they were out of my size. I received an email today that the size was in and I did get that second pair ordered today, yeah! Overall a great shoe, and many colors available.
Fast delivery, true to size and feel great after walking all day at the Air & Space Museum.
