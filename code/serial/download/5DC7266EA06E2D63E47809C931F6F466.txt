Hi-Tec Total Terrain Aero
I got these in an 8 because the 7.5 (my normal size) was unavailable.  The 8 was too long in the toe.  However, I think in the right size, these are a great shoe.  Possibly a little narrow in the toe, but without the proper size it is hard to say.  I'm finding all the hiking shoes I'm trying seem a little narrow in the toe, so I think it might be me.  Not crazy tread, but definitely adequate.  Seems like a good shoe to me.
