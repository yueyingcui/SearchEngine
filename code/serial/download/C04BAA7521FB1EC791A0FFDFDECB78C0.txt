Keen Utility PTC Slip-On II
Overall, comfortable and nicely constructed shoe. Fits well and true to size, like the tread and as always love the Keen cushion insert.
I am a chef and stand on a hard tile floor for 10-18 hours a day. For the last 8 years I have been using the free Shoes-For-Crews (SFC) my company provides. Lately the quality has gone down and it was time to upgrade my footwear. I needed something waterproof, comfortable, durable, and lace free. Chefs know how crusty and gross your laces can get when you spill sauces on your shoes, etc. So this shoe seemed perfect. At twice the price of SFC, might be twice the longevity? I only wore them for a short while but here are a few points about the shoes. 1. Yes, they will make your socks black. 2. I wear thick, moisture wicking WigWam work socks and the shoes were still a half size too big. 3. Yes, I can tell your feet will sweat more than normal with these shoes. 4. It may have been very cold outside but I noticed they sounded more like dress shoes while walking, not very quiet, but not annoying either. 5. I noticed that the opening for your foot was not very big, took some effort to get them on but my heel kept sliding out. A bit worried what a half-size down will be like.
