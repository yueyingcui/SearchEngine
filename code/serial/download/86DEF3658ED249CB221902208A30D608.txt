EMU Australia Kids Baby Bootie (Infant)
The boots looked larger than I expected them to be (I ordered them in 12-18 months). My daughter is in size 12 in clothing, but is only 9 months old. The boots are slightly large on her, but they are so plush that they fit her and will fit her for a while. They are really stylish and cute!
These looks so cute!  I have them in the 6-12month size.  They are a bit bulky but keep little toes and feet very warm.  The color is more like a blush pink but goes with everything.
