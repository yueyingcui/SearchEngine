New Balance Classics WL442
Happy feet! Fun colors, comfortable, true to size. Probably not great for sports, but just right for looking good while out and about
The shoe is cute as anticipated but fit a little on the small side. I need to exchange for one half size up. Also fits a little narrow. Can't wait to get them in my size!
I bought a pair of the New Balance style Number 442 shoes years ago. I absolutely love them. I have been looking for a long time for something both in the grey/black family (old ones are brown). So happy I found these. Great color! I did have to return them for a half size smaller. They fit fine at the heel but had a small amount of room at the toe. 

Ordered a size 9 originally, returned for 8.5. 
I took the advice of the other commenters and went 1/2 a size up, but they are a little big. I think maybe it's because I also went with wide. I am going to try them out with thick socks and see if that makes much a difference.
