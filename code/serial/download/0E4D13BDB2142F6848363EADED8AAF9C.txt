UGG Kids Kameron (Toddler/Youth)
I bought these in the kids size because they were cheaper then the grown up pair. I wish I had gotten a size smaller because the 5 are big. Overall they are okay; wish they had the fur on the bottom.
I bought these as a replacement for my daughter after the dog ate her first pair, which were in an adult size 8. The kids version was less expensive and the youth size 6 was exactly the same size as the adult 8. The insole was not quite as nice, being perfectly flat with no arch support. But my daughter wanted to keep them so I bought her a pair of Dr. Scholl's insoles that are cushiony and have great arch support for $12. Overall, it worked out well.
These are very soft leather and have nice fuzzy wool around the ankle and on the tongue. They do not have a lot of arch support or cushioning on the footbed, but they have plenty of width in the toe area to make a comfortable fit. I usually wear a woman's 6Â½ and I ordered a youth 5 and they fit well. If you are a half size, you should order the next size up.
