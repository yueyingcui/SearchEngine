Vans Kids Old Skool V Core  (Infant/Toddler)
My son has wide feet and sometimes it's hard to find the right shoe, but these Vans were perfect. The 6.5 is comparable to Adidas size 7, but wider. Word of caution, these shoes are heavy. If you have a kicker, it will hurt. :) My son gets compliments on these all the time. Just yesterday, someone walked past and said to their wife, look honey, he has on little Vans!
Awesome shoes. My son loves them and he is only 3 and can put them on by himself. Very sturdy sole. Runs true to size.
We love these shoes! Worth paying a little more for quality shoes that will take a beating and still last a long time. I also like that they are a little roomy. I wouldn't say a full or half size bigger but there is certainly a little room to accommodate some growth.

Love these Vans for my son!  Super cute, easy to put on and I love that they come in half sizes!
Good looking shoe but way too big. I had my son's feet measured and he measured at 5.5, almost 6. I got these in a size 6 and there is no way they will fit. I think they are at least a full size larger than marked.
Quality shoe for an active five-year old boy.  Easy for him to put on and take off.  We have not worn them much, as I hope to have them for school in September. The size is generous.
Big fan of Vans.
My 2 year old loves these and won't take them off. I'll have to buy the next size up soon and will buy exactly the same thing. He wears them almost every day and they still held up well.
