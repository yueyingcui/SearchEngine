Sanuk Rio
I really mulled over this purchase, not sure if the light blue color was right for me.  I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived and just loved the pattern and colors. I slipped them on and the right shoe seemed slightly tight and pushed my toes together ever so slightly.  I don't have wide feet, so I found this particularly odd, especially since my left foot is larger than my right.  I sat with them for awhile telling myself I must be crazy.  Soon, my feet were sweating.  I often wear shoes without socks and I don't usually have this problem.  Perhaps a fabric insole instead of the foam rubber would have solved this problem.  If my feet had not started sweating, I probably would have sent them back for another pair in the same size, hoping the right shoe was was just a fluke.  
I love these shoes.  Nice colors, comfy sole, easy to wear all day. I could use a half size smaller, but they only come in whole sizes.
I LOVE THESE SHOES! I wear an 8 1/2 usually but bought these in a size 8, and they fit like a glove. The picture on-line doesn't do justice to the cuteness of these shoes. I say, buy them!

I probably needed a half size which was not available so I ordered up to a full size that was too big. It says powder/light blue but colors that show most on show are orange and avocado design with just hint of blue in background. I did order one other pairs of Sanuks and I kept them. They are lined and seemed to fit a little more true to size maybe because they are fleece lined. They are a little slipper looking but I still think will be cute with right casual outfit.
