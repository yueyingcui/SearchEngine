Salomon Fellcross
I am very pleased with this shoe.  Lightweight, easy on/off, comfortable, true to size, supportive, water resistant, stable.
The cleats are a little slippery on hard slick surfaces but no problem just be ready. 
I wear them as daily shoes with no problems.  They may be a little warm for some when wearing them all day but not a problem.
Oh and expect a lot of complements.

An excellent shoe. Compared these to Pearl Izumi Peak, Inov-8 Bare & X-Talon. One of the most comfortable and well built shoes I've tried on (and bought) in a while. Super high quality construction. Killer looks. Excellent aggressive lugs on the bottom. This shoe works as I was looking for something that I could rely on for harsh trail events and during bad weather. No concerns there...I do wish Salomon would take this shoe design and trim it down to a more minimalist approach. Try not to sacrifice anything on the upper design, but take some of the support out of the heel cup and maybe eliminate some of the cushioning on the bottom. 6-7 oz seems to be that magic weight for a racing flat and at something like 9-10 oz. (for size 10), these aren't quite as spritely as I would want for racing. I could also take less heel support in a typical shoe, but on aggressive trails and terrain, I don't think I'll mind the snug and supportive fit. To temper my comments, the heel cup is more minimalist than a typical running shoe, just more present than I would want it to be for racing. Note on width: If you size down because they run large (I'm a 10.5 US and use 10's), the width is on the comfortable side of normal. I have a wider foot but the design wraps my foot comfortably and allows the forefoot to spread out with weight and toe push-off (but is a little too snug if just sitting around).
