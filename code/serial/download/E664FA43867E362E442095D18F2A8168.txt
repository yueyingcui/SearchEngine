Anne Klein Undertake
The fit with these was long. I run true to size lengthwise, and have a medium to wide foot for which they felt fine, but my heel was slipping up, so these would be problematic for me.
This is my second time buying these shoes.  They are so comfortable!  The second pair however,seems tight on my right foot and loose on my left.  Never have had this happen before.  Both shoes say size 7, so idk?  I thin kI'm sending them back and sticking with the first broken-in pair!
