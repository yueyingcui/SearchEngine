Keen Kids Coronado High Top (Youth)
Clodhoppers.  That's the only word to describe them.  I got a size 6 youth and they were extremely wide and stiff uncomfortable.  I love my size 6 youth keen newport sandals, so I thought these would be good.  
These are very well made nice looking shoes. However, they run very large. My daughter wears a 3 sometimes closer to 4. I ordered a size 3 and they are at least 1 size too large. I will reorder a size 2 and cross my fingers that they are considerably smaller.
