Mizuno Wave® Nexus™ 6 
These shoes were amazing! I trained for a marathon and ran it in them without any pain. I ran approximately 40-60 miles a week and they were light but still provided support. They did not take very long to break in and were a great buy! I always get my running shoes half a size bigger and got an 8½ when I am normally an 8.
This shoe felt sloppy on.  For being a medium width, which is what I wear, it is very wide. The size is a bit large also. I may try in half size smaller, but am afraid it might also be too wide.
