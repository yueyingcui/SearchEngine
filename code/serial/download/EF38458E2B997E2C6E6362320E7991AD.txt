Just as everyone says-get a size down for a better fit. Great shoes. Very happy with them and all the reviewers. It helps so much with selection. 
I ordered these in my usual size and they fit a little big. But not big enough to size down. I will use a heel insert and they will fit perfect. They are the most comfortable shoes I have. They are very light and feel like you are walking on air. Awesome!
I love these shoes! They are the most comfortable sneakers I've ever worn. I have had them a year and they still feel great. I wore them for two straights weeks in Ireland and almost every day since and they are still looking and feeling good! I ordered my size but when they arrived realized I needed a half size down. Keep in mind when ordering.
Love these shoes. They are so light and not clunky at all. The zebra pattern is fun, I've tried to get them in my size for several months, I held out and I'm glad I did. I like the way they fit my foot a little better than Toms shoes, too. I wear a 7 1/2 and ordered a 7 and it's a perfect fit. The 8 would definitely be too big. Great shoe!

Loved these shoes, but had to return them for a size smaller. They run big, but are so comfortable!
