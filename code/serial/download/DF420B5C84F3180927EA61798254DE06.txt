Salomon RX Slide 2
These shoes are not only really good looking, but they are extremely comfortable. I had to return the first pair and get half a size larger so the heel of my foot did not rest on the back lip of the shoe. I had read that the shoe ran large, but I think it runs short in the footbed. It does run wide which is nice for me since I wear a wide, but for those with narrow feet, you may want to rethink these shoes. I absolutely love the colors and the comfort.
Nice shoe, runs a full size too big though. Will be either exchanging or returning for a smaller size. Runs wide also, if you have trouble keeping this style shoe on your foot, not the shoe for you...It's roomy.
