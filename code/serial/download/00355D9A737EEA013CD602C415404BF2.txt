Macbeth Matthew
Since Macbeth doesn't make a lot of women's shoes, they're quite hard to find in the right size. These are great shoes, size 5 fits perfect (usually a size 7 in women's).
I loved the Matthew from Macbeth and I have a lot of Macbeth shoes. The material is light with a large bit of rubber around the base of the toe for good durability. The insole has a extra bit of padding foam underneath which is nice though it does wear after a while like most shoes. There is not a lot of cushion on the inside so buy your size as this is one of the only Macbeth shoes I found fit true to size on the first try. One of my favourite features of this shoe is the big of reinforced strip of rubber on the inside of the heel, to fiz the problem with the Eliot.  This bit of rubber makes the heel harder which makes the shoe easier to put on and after a lot of wear it's still in tact.  Another low profile shoe so there is not much arch support.  It is a bit wider than the Eliot though not much but the light material does allow for some give. All in all a great shoe by Macbeth.
I purchased these as a gift for my boyfriend. I ordered a 10, a 10½ and an 11 so he could choose the size that fit best. He ended up going with the 10½ so I would say these fit true to size. They look amazing on him and he loves them. He says they have a lot better support than his Converse, but still have that same slim look to them.
Great looking shoes, but were horribly uncomfortable for a while. They are still uncomfortable after a couple weeks, but not as bad. A lot of pain in the very stiff heel of these shoes, and some pain on the sides of my foot due to them being narrow. They feel about a half size smaller than they should be also. They look great, but are the most uncomfortable shoe I've ever owned. They are slowly getting better.
