SKECHERS GO Walk - Nice
Wore these for the first time on a business trip where I had to hike for hours in parks and on trails. There is no break in time with these shoes. Put them on and you can go for days. I only wish I'd purchased two pair - and now that I think about it, will go back and get another pair. They run true to size (and I have big feet 9 1/2). The color is spectacular. I am so happy that I bought these. Skechers is a brand that rocks anyway.
