inov-8 Terroc™ 345 GORE-TEX®
These are advertised as unisex; however, they run about a half size bigger than normal shoes and are wide. I went on an 8 mile hike to try them out and they did not hold up like I expected, and were anything but comfortable. Needless to say these were donated right after I got home from the hike and I will not purchase this brand again. I had much better results with North Face and Timberland hiking shoes. These are just over hyped, overpriced, waste of money and time.
