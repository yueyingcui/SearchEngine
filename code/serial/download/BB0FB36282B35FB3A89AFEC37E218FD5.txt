Salomon XR Mission     
Stop the bus! Riotously conspicuous, anonymity denied, your neighbors will see you from 1/2 mile distance. I use the North Face Women's Ultra 50 for trail running and use the Salomon XR Mission for about town. Comfortable, true to fit (I just scaled down commensurately on size), these sneakers are out-of-the-box fantastic. All pros, no cons, except a side note to commit no transgressions while sporting these kicks; the bobbies will have you locked up in 5 minutes.
I am just waiting for the size 7½ to arrive. I tried the 8, the smallest size, at a local sporting goods store two days ago. The fit was good, support and comfort were right on! I did not buy the shoes because they were 1/2" longer, though it felt great. The width on these is D, I normally am 4E. I just want to try the 7½ to see how they fit. Hopefully, like the 8 or better.
