Avia A5018W
These shoes were a great value for the low price, however I had to send the first pair back as they run large. Once I received a smaller size I was very happy with them.
As soon as I put these shoes on my feet, I knew that I had finally found them! Seriously, people, I had shopped an entire outlet mall of other name brand shoes finding many in my size and I was very hopeful. I was even ready to pay the price for more expensive shoes had I found any that fit. I am always in between sizes, width too narrow, weird colors. I found nothing. I wear a size 9Â½ medium but my feet run a little wide. I also have high arches. These shoes accommodate both with no break in period and the price is right! I may order another pair to stash for the next time I need to replace shoes!
I wear a size 9.5 wide and at age 55+, style is less of a factor than comfort, although I have no complaints about their appearance. My feet are sensitive and difficult to please; I must wear very smooth thin socks. These shoes are light, comfortable and you can't beat the price. I was pleasantly surprised.  
These are the best running shoes that I have ever bought. So I continue to buy this Avia model. I am suspecting, though, that it has been discontinued, which is why I snapped up the last pair in my size. They offer stability, cushioning and flexibility, are lightweight, has generously placed reflectors all around the shoe, not just on the heel, and offers great traction.
A very comfortable shoe, I wear them all day at work, very lightweight and true to size, will order again.
