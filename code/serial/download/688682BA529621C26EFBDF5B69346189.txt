ASICS GEL-DS RacerÂ® 9
A great pair of super lightweight running shoes. Less cushion than my previous Asics but much lighter. Very happy with them. Would probably size up if you're unsure, they run a bit small.
Great shoes! Run a half size small - I normally wear a 10.5 in an Asics 2160, but had to step up to an 11 for this shoe. Although this is not a wide shoe (it is a D width), and I normally wear a 2E in Asics, these fit very well, with only a small amount of tightness in the width. Very light shoe - almost feel like slippers. You can notice a lack of cushioning over an everyday trainer, but this is only a race day or speed work day shoe. Very happy with these! Have run a 1/2 marathon and 8K race, and several speed days on the track in these.

I bought this sneaker because it was listed under the 'padded' section and stated as having a 'gel' pad. I need a lot of support in order to have a comfortable run. The padding in this sneaker was extremely weak and I got no sense of a 'gel' pad anywhere. Padding in sneakers wear away over time and I could tell after about a month or so, the sneaker would have that 'flat' feeling (once what padding it does have, flatten down). Also, I ordered a size 9 man's and it was extremely tight. Hope this helps.
