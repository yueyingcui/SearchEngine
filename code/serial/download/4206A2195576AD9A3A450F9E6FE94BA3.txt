SKECHERS KIDS Ibex - Humvee Lights 90360L (Toddler/Youth)
They seem to be really nice shoes...but...they seem to run small. We ordered a size 1 and 1.5, according to the size chart on the shoe. The 1's should have just fit...but our son couldn't even get his foot into the shoe. The 1.5's fit...but his toes were right at the end. I'm now going to send these back and order the 2's. Hopefully they will work, because the shoes are really nice looking and our son can't wait to get to wear them.
