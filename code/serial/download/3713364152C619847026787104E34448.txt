Salomon RX Snowmoc LTR
I am a security guard working on a college campus, spending 8 hours walking in whatever weather conditions. I bought these for winter use and wasn't sure how they would hold up in East Coast winter weather. Well the first winter storm just hit us, and I was at work during it. I walked in the rain, snow and sleet, and these shoes kept my feet completely warm and dry!! I had on a light pair of dress socks to boot! These shoes not only met but exceeded my expectations!! They felt a little tight, but I like slip-on shoes to fit more snugly, but anyone not wanting the break-in time I would recommend a half size larger. If you need comfort, warmth, and water proof these are shoes for you!
