Ryka Aspire
Very cute. Love the colors and the shoes are so light-weight it feels like you don't have shoes on. Rykas seem to feel good width-wise because of the wider toe box. On the downside, I ordered several styles of the Rykas before choosing this one and did find them to run a little small. I would suggest ordering a half size bigger than you normally wear.
I have been wearing these shoes for about 3 weeks. I wear them every other day for elliptical or treadmill exercising. Since most of the upper of the shoe is mesh, it breathes well but doesn't have the support of a leather upper as the mesh is more "fluid" than leather. I love the more rounded toe because I hate my toes to be mashed together - even slightly. I added an extra insole and a peel and stick arch support to better suit my needs (I ordered up one whole size to accommodate these additions). I am most happy with these shoes because of the rounded toe.
