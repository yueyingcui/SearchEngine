Shimano SH-MT33L
I wear a size 8D. I could barely get the size 42 on (8.3). The size 43 (8.9) was hardly bigger. Rather heavy and otherwise well designed except for that ridiculous spur on the heel.
Comfortable, lightweight. Sizes are close. I wear an 11 went with the 11.2 or 46 in their sizes. My feet are a little wider than a D but the shoe has a little give.
This shoe is one of the very, very few that work with old style basket toe clips.  Delivery was prompt.
If you need an inbetween size, use the next larger size as they run a little small.  My foot is hard to fit and this work very well with thin socks.
Bought these for indoor cycling as they say in the specs. I like them, but they are a bit big, even though the US size listed was a smaller than I usually get in other shoes. I love comfortable, semi-normal looking biking shoes like these and think they would be OK outside as well, but you would have to be careful not to catch the lace in the chain ring, something that the top Velcro strap in other biking shoes with laces helps to control.
These are great, straight-forward cycling shoes. It's very easy to install the cleats and they breath great. Your feet might get cold while biking in cold weather, so I would recommend getting the next size up if you will need to wear some think socks. I would also say these are not the shoes you want to wear if you are going to do a ton of walking off the bike. They're fine for a short stroll, but anything over .5 miles is likely going to get annoying because they are a bit stiff in the toe box.
I bought these for my husband and he was so excited to finally get to use clips. He loves them and wears them almost everyday when mountain biking. 
He wears a 9 to 9 1/2 and we had to return a size 43 (they were a little too tight in width) for a 44, which fit him perfectly.
