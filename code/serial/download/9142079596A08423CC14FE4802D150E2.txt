New Balance Classics ML501
Finding non-leather New Balance Classics is very difficult.  And finding them in size 14 is sometimes impossible.  According to the description these have suede but according to New Balance customer service they do not.  As far as I can tell the material is all synthetic and the wide width is very comfortable for me so I'm pleased.
Great shoes, right size, good delivery time, and decent price. What else could you ask?
Width is important to me.
Very nice look to this shoe. Very comfortable but they run a little small I would order a 1/2 size bigger. 
What's become of New Balance.  This is the second different pair that's a good size smaller than the 9.5 ee I have always bought from them.  I must return them to Zappo's when I get back from the trip I was hoping to wear them on.It's too bad.  I think my brand loyalty is done.  Who's next?
For the past few years, I only buy EE New Balance shoes. And 9 has always been the best size. This style of New Balance seemed to run smaller, though, so I ended up getting a 9Â½. They are great shoes. They are stylish and the extra width is hardly noticeable in the visual design. Some wide shoes look like they ae designed for monster feet.
After owning this pair and wearing them for a while I decided that they really do not ventilate well at all. The canvas portion (the color accent that wraps the shoe, specifically below the laces) has even shown sweat from casual usage and I wear UnderArmor wool/spandex socks. I do not consider myself to be an over foot-perspiring individual either. They are true to size and I do, as usual, really like the aesthetics. They are just not the most conforming materials. I like my 574s better. They are clothier.
True to size and very comfortable. I can walk all day in these and it looks fashionable. Can't ask for more from a pair of sneakers at this price. It seems to be breathable as well. It would be perfect it I could do some jogging in these.
