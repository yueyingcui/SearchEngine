Heelys Caution (Toddler/Youth/Adult)
I ordered the Heelys for my 10 year old daughter a couple days before Christmas. When they arrived, they were neatly placed inside of another box. When my daughter opened the box on Christmas, she absolutely loved them. They were true to size and there were no problems with the operation of the wheels on the shoes. I would definitely recommend anyone out there who has a child that has expressed interest in skate shoes, to order these shoes.
The shoes arrived on time and where exactly what I ordered. They did come true to size. My granddaughter has not taken them off; it was her best gift for Christmas.
I need to return for a bigger size.  I've lost my shipping lable to return.   Please advise on what to do.  I don't have the correct size yet but will let you know when I return.  Thanks so much.
I was told not to order a size larger as these were "true to size". In the past, I had to buy a bigger size in the store as Heelys tend to fit very small. I was given the correct information when I ordered and the shoes came very quickly. It was all good!
Great looking shoes!  Followed the instructions to buy a size larger than you normally wear and they fit perfectly.  My son loves them!
The size is true and they were a perfect fit! The ease of ordering and speed of delivery was fantastic. Thank you!
