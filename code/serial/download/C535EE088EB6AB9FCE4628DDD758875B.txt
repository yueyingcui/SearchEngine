Sperry Kids A/O (Toddler/Youth)
These shoes are great for my 6 year old son, but they are giant! He wears a 13 sneaker, so I ordered a 13.5 shoe so he would have a little room to grow-they just arrived and are enormous- by maybe an inch or two! Exchanging for two other sizes to try again...
I love this classic. I bought these for my son, who only wears sneakers, for special occasions. He actually wore them without complaining. And, here's the good thing, at age 12 we are the same shoe size so I will get them when he grows out. Hey, what can I say? The 80s were good to me.
Love! I bought these classic Sperrys in youth size because the woman's size was too big for me.. I usually wear a women size 5.5 but Sperry size 5 easily slipped off my feet when I'd try to walk so i returned them and got these in youth 4! Still big! exchanging it to 3.5, but still they are so stylish yet classic and simple. they basically go with anything, cute shorts/jeans/skirts and even casual dresses! comfy to walk in too.
I had to order this three times and I'm still not satisfied. First time, they didn't have the size I ordered. Second time, it was too big so I gave it to my friend. Third time, it fit but the sole of the shoe flaps up and it's not secured on. Also there's a dent(?) on top of the shoe like it's been knifed. But I still like the shoe and its color so I'm going to keep trying.
These shoes are wonderful, very comfortable! Make sure you get the right size and that they are not too big because they can scrape your heel if they are a bit loose.

Perfect Sunday shoe, just as pictured. We purchased a larger size to let my son grow into them, and he loves them. 

Great classic shoes. Prepare for blisters initially, though. Fit true to size. 

I bought two for my 6 year old and 4 year old boys.  It\'s very light weight and comfortable.  Plus, it\'s easy to put on.  They both liked it!  FYI, Sperry shoes run large like Vans.  I ordered 1 size smaller than their usual size.
