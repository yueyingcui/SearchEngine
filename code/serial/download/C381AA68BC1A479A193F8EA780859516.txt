Tsukihoshi Kids Denali (Toddler/Youth)
My grandson loves these shoes. They are light weight, easy to put on and very comfortable. We have many different styles of this brand of shoes. Be sure to order a a size smaller than your child usually wears. 
Tsukihoshi's are my son's preferred sneaker. This is his fourth pair. He has wide feet. It's easy to clean (just pop it in the washer). Do get it a half size smaller as is recommended.
My son has this shoe in light blue/taupe color and loves them. This is my son's 4th pair of Tsukihoshis. My son is happy with the fit/lightweight, we're both happy with the style, and I'm happy with the fact that I can throw them in the washer. I always order 1/2 a size smaller that what he normally wears. For example, his other pair of shoes is usually a Stride-Rite pair and his Tsuki's are always half a size smaller, they fit perfectly every time. I will continue to buy him Tsuki's until he outgrows the brand sizing. Thank you for offering a great product.
These sneakers are durable and cute. My daughter loves them. I love that I can wash them and they come out looking like new.
This brand overall runs about a half size big.
