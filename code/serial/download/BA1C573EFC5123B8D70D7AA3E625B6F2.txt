Johnston & Murphy Johnston & Murphy Dress Belt
I have some J/M brown shoes and the brown was an exact color match. That was nice. There's nothing fabulous about the belt---it's just a well made, quality dress belt with a nice silver buckle. I sucked it up and ordered a size up and am glad that I did because it actually fits and works better than some 38's that I own. Lesson learned there. A good belt at a fair price. Can't ask for much more than that.
The belt came today and I am very pleased with it â€“ BUT please know that it runs small. I always wear a 34" belt, my closet has nothing but 34" belts, but this belt is much smaller. I couldn't even use the first hole. I am ordering the next size up and expect that it will be fine.
