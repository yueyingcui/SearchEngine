Patagonia Drifter GORE-TEXÂ®
My second pair and I will buy a third just to keep on hand. Buy one size larger than your normal size.
My husband is hard to please when it comes to shoes, but he loves these Patagonia Drifters. Actually, he raves about them! It took a few tries to get the right size. His normal size 10 was too loose in the heel, so he went with the 9.5 and they are perfect for him. They are absolutely waterproof and sturdy and comfortable. These shoes are sturdy and rugged anough to wear hiking and also look good enough to wear with jeans when walking around town. 
I am one of the most difficult to fit. Serious flat fleet, heavy pronation and a collapsed arch. This shoe "fit like a glove". Very supportive, true to size and comfortable from the get go. Only issue is trying to get a snug lacing.
