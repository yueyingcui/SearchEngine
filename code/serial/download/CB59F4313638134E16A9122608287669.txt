The North Face Kids NSE Fleece Bootie (Infant)
These are super cute! I usually love The North Face products, but I have a couple complaints about these booties. Most importantly, they ran small. I would have ordered a larger size, or a different North Face boot, but North Face doesn't make infant boots any larger than 6-9 months, and they don't make toddler boots at all. Why not?! Such a shame.
