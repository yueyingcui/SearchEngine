SKECHERS Bikers-Deuce
I love the look of this shoe! I wear a size 10 but they made my feet look smaller than usual. Unfortunately, the shoes aren't very supportive. After puzzling over it and studying the shoe, I realized that the sole is somewhat curved and I believe this contributed to the feeling I had that my weight was not evenly distributed.
