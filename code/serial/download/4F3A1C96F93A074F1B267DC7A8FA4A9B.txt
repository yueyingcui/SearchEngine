Giro Riela
Wish they had a larger size in womens cycling shoes! I wear an 11 street shoe, and occasionally a 10. Decided to try the 42.5 to see if it would work since I am having a hard time finding cycling shoes for my big feet. Got my foot in them but my toes were smashed up against the ends. Otherwise these are really cute. Going to try this brand in the mens sizes instead.
