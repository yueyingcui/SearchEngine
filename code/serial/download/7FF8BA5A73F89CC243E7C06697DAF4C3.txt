Ahnu Sequoia II
Just got shoes in! Get your exact size for better fit. Shoe is comfortable. Don't like the thin shoe laces, but overall great shoe.
Nice sneak...s'truth that shoe doesn't slip or rub during stride. Problem is sizing. 9 usually works great, but for this one, large toe kept hitting toe box. Size up at least a half size!
I love this shoe.  Lightweight, plenty of room for my toes, very good arch support, slightly stiff which supports my feet for walking and light hiking.  For me, true to size in an 11.  And really nice looking in the Total Eclipse.
Total eclipse. Beautiful Navy/Jean-friendly color. Runs short. I need the next 1/2-size larger, which is unusual. Fabulous Vibram Sole for nasty weather, slippery conditions, hiking. Arch of shoe hit me too far forward.
