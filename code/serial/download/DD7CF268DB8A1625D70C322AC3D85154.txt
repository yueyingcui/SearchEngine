Vivobarefoot Off-Road Mid
Well made, high quality shoes. Stiff leather uppers and take some breaking in. Feels a bit more narrow than the Vivo Barefoot Neo Trails that I also have in the same size, but still has a roomy toebox unlike most so-called barefoot or minimalist shoes. Order one size up. Waterproofing is good, not very breathable. Sole is excellent - good durability, good proprioception and near barefoot feel. The best part is the shoe looks inconspicuous and professional (OK for casual business attire at work) and works great for running, hiking, golf and work. Highly recommended.
