Nike Action Braata Lite W
These shoes are way too huge. My shoe size is usually consistent, around 6½. For this pair I felt like I needed a 5½. I cannot really rate them on comfort since they are too large. However, they do look nice on the feet, and the lavender color is beautiful!
I got these in the mail yesterday and thought they were so cute! I bought these a half size larger than my normal size (I wear an 8 and bought these in 8.5) because of the reviews, and I was so sad to find out that they were too big. I think I should've taken into account how narrow my feet are. Cute, but too big.
They felt a little smaller than shoe size. Very comfortable, and they look awesome! If you like other Nike shoes you'll love these!
