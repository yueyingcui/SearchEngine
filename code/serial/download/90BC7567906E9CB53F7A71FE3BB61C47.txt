Merrell Barefoot Slant Glove
The Slant Glove barefoot have become my shoes of choice. I use them as a cross between an everyday shoe and runner.  Love them! Like all the Merrel barefoots, I wear a half size smaller to fit.
I'm ordering another pair I like these so much. One pair for gardening, one for the gym and maybe a third pair for around town. I don't care if they're true barefoot style or not, these are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. I ran a mile on the treadmill and these felt fantastic, first time out. They were much more comfortable than the lace-ups; not so tight on the top of the foot. Order up half a size.
