Sperry Kids A/O (Youth)
Woz, what a great shoe! I wore these as a teenager, and the quality is just as great now! I purchased this for my 15-year old in 4.5 (she's a size 6 woman's), and they fit perfectly. These have a bonus removable arch support as well. Great quality, construction, and that Sperry leather is soft as ever!
These shoes are comfortable, easy to slip on, and the metallic finish makes them look cool. They're easy to wear semi-dressed up or down. Because they are a shoe that slips on and stretches from wear, we needed a half size smaller than usual to make them fit properly.

This was one of the very few places I could even find the kid's sizes of this style and my daughter was THRILLED. The shipping service is wonderful and the shoe was perfect. It seemed slightly larger than a regular 4 but should fit fine for the summer. It was soft and smooth and the color was great. Would definitely recommend.
