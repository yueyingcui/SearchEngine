K-Swiss Blade-Maxâ„¢ Stable
Nice shoe. They feel so comfortable. They didn't have a women's size 9 so I got a men's size 7 and it worked quite well. I also have gotten lots of compliments on how good my shoe looks. These are the most colorful shoes that I've ever purchased in my life, I guess it's menopause.
Very cushioned and comfortable shoe. Unfortunately, too narrow in the toe box for my wide foot. Wish they made wide width. Shoe is true to size.
