ASICS Gel-BlurÂ® 33 TR
These shoes are well constructed and the sole provide great support. The grey part (mesh that hold the laces) felt like it was separate from the shoe. It is not a big problem because the shoe was design that way. Everything is normal in size. If you have wide feet, buy the wider version if they have it. This is my first time buying from this brand so I will inspect it further to see if I will purchase it again.
