Garmont Momentum GTX
Wore these shoes right out of the box and found them very comfortable. Went on a three mile hike and still pleased. Back of my heel was a bit sensitive next day when I wore the shoes, but that could be because I hadn't hiked in a while; love the shoes too much to blame them yet. Didn't walk through any puddles yet, but I did spill some water on them and it rolled right off. Note: ran a half size small for me; I'm a 7.5-8, and I needed an 8.5. Also love that no animals had to be murdered to make these shoes.
