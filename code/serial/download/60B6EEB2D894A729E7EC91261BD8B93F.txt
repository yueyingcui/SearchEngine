PUMA TT Super CC
A comfy and sturdy shoe with great looks. I typically wear a size 11 in Pumas, but could easily have gotten away with a 10.5. Great for casual wear and causal/commuting cycling.
Most comfortable sneaker I have owned in years. I have this in two colors and would buy more if they had my size. As long as you get the right size, my foot is a 10.5 EE and I bought these in a 12 and they fit perfectly for both length and width, so the sizing is a little screwy. But the shoes are super fly. I rock them with jeans and a T or with a button down and blazer. Love 'em.
These are super cute shoes. I am wearing them quite frequently. I love the hint of orange on the sole. They run true to size.
These shoes are super cute. I love the faded navy color with the orange/red soles. I normally wear size 7 or 7.5 in womens. I ordered the 7.5 and am glad I did because there's not much room left in the toe. Definitely go to bigger size if you are between sizes. Before I bought them, I read the other reviews about no arch support and being uncomfortable for long wear. I thought maybe they just had bad feet, but I have to say that I totally agree. I have good arches and most shoes don't bother me, but I will definitely be buying an arch support for these shoes. They are way too cool for me to even consider sending them back because of the arch issue.
These shoes are lightweight, yet seem sturdy. They kind of feel like wrestling shoes, actually. I have flat feet (size 13) and these shoes are quite comfortable for me to wear--no severe arch support which can be uncomfortable for me. The top (around yr ankle) is cut lower than I thought it would be, but that doesn't really matter too much; they are still comfortable and look fine to me.
