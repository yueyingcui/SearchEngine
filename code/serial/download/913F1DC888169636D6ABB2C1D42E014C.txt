Hoka One One Bondi B Leather
I was worried about these fitting correctly, but a friend of mine said hers were true to size, and I'm glad I trusted her: I have a very wide foot and was worried, but the 9.5 (sometimes I'm a 9 purely because of width go up a half size). It fits perfectly, and is actually maybe even a little big. The shock absorption is phenomenal: I got these and the trail shoe since I'm recovering from plantar fasciitis and need a really supportive shoe to keep it healing. When on my feet all day as a waitress, I'm almost always sore, but these make a huge difference. They look a little dorky/funny, like Shapeups, and you might accidentally step on a foot or two (be careful around people with sandals!) but once you're used to them, it's great. Highly recommend to anyone who's on their feet a lot or has a heavy footfall -- really incredibly bouncy. I also go trail running for real in my other Hokas and all my ultrarunner friends swear by them, and they're definitely great for "real" use as well as casual, just by the way.
