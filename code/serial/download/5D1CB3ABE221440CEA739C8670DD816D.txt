Sperry Kids Boat Lug H&L (Youth)
These shoes are fantastic! We bought them for our 5 year old son who needed a pair of dressier shoes. We have never had Sperrys before, and we are so pleased! These have a sort of chic European look to them. The construction is amazing; I love the topstitching and the lug sole. My son loves them - says they are so comfortable. These are very well made and we expect that they will last for a long time, at least until he outgrows them! My husband wishes they had this style in his size!
