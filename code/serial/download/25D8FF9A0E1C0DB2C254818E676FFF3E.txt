These shoes are very comfortable and fit true to size. They are also very versatile in the light beige/off white color. The laces can be used to adjust the fit. I am very happy with this purchase!
Amazing! Perfect casual shoes. Got these in the dark brown and gold metallic and wear them just about everywhere. I ordered half a size smaller than my regular shoe size as they seemed to run big and stretch out a bit over time. Nothing but compliments on both colors! No idea what I wore before I had these - just buy them.
My daughter ordered a size 9 for herself and size 8 for me.  She kept the 8 for herself because the 9 was too large.  I wear a 7.5 or 8, but have a size 7 in this boat shoe.
