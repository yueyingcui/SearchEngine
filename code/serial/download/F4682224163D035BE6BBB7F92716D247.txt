Timberland PRO TiTANÂ® Safety Toe Oxford
I've owned several pairs of these boots and they're awesome. I tried a cheaper pair and after 6 hours standing at work my feet were killing me! With these boots 12-14 hour shifts are no problem. Very comfortable! They look great too. I wear them as my street shoes as well. IMHO the only boots for me. One note, would buy up a size from normal.
They feel pretty comfortable and have decent arch support. They look nice and appear durable thus far. Seems to be long and narrow for the size I chose.
