Call it SPRING Felmlee
Great looking shoe and felt nice had it been it's proper size.  Wore for a short period of time before the pain set in.  I was very disappointed to find that 13 was the maximum size this brand offered.  Oh well.  Back to searching for the perfect shoe to go with my Phillies gear.
