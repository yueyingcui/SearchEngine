New Balance WW910
Awesome feeling shoe! I just got them from the mail man and put them on my feet and went oh ya! So comfortable right out of the box! By reading the reviews I went a half size larger than I usually wear and they fit perfect! When I slipped the shoe on it felt like their was no arch support till I stood up my feet were cradled in comfort!
These shoes are comfortable but the size is small. I had to order half a size larger than what I normally use.
Comfortable, lightweight, well-made cushy insole but no arch support. Seems a bit narrower and shorter than expected for a 7-1/2 wide, compared to other same size and width NB shoes I have, but they will do with a thinner sock. 4 stars due to those issues.
