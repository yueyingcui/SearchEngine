ASICS GEL-FujiRacer™
Spartan Tested. Race Approved. In a brief week, I put these shoes through hell and back. A 20 mile pre-race break in period. Followed by a five tortuous mile Military Spartan Obstacle Course at Fort Carson, Colorado. These shoes did not let me down, not one bit. They lived up to the hefty price tag. If you never have seen a Spartan Race then it is filled with climbing, running, jumping, crawling in pits of mud, over hills and rocks, through muddy streams, sewers, ditches, up steep dirt banks, arduous wooden ramps covered in dirt and slippery soap, over balance beams, walls, rucksack climbs up mountains, and more, all the while maintaining your running composure between obstacles. These shoes got drenched, they were weighted down by clay and mud, stretched in 45° climbs and ascents in the dirt of mountains, and held their grip in all 23 obstacles thrown their way. At the end, I was smoked. These shoes were not. They got me to the finish line! After three loads through the washing machine, they look and smell as good as new. They stand ready to run another race this weekend! I shopped around when making this selection. I chose the Asics Gel Fuji Racers over other shoes and they met my requirements - the right combination of comfort, lateral stability and (light) weight. These shoes run small so you will need to order a plus half size larger. They are perfect for Spartan Racing. They are perfect for training. They are also perfect for everyday wear.
