I would suggest buying at least half a size up for these. I own a pair of size 11 Cesario Lo's, which fit perfectly, and tried a 10.5, which were just too tight. Knowing this, I first purchased a size 11 in this style, but found it much too big and exchanged it for the 10.5. There is still a slight amount of leeway, but going down to a 10 is probably too small.
