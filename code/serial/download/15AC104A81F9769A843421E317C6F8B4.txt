adidas Originals Pro Model
Awesome looking shoes. Not a lot of support; they aren't as comfortable as they look. Totally worth the price though. Order at least a half size larger, these run small.
These Adidas are very comfortable.  They feel true to size. I wear a 5.5.  I definately recommend these sneakers.  I bought them because they're high tops but I got even more than that.
I was having a hard time locating these sneakers flat out went to all chain sneaker stores and so called specialty sneaker shops nobody carried them. Went on your site; had them in my size. They were shipped quickly and price is good. I can't be happier will always check you out for any footwear needs. Thanks.
