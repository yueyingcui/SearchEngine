Converse Kids Chuck Taylor® All Star® Loop-2-Knot Slip (Infant/Toddler)
I was so happy to find this shoe in a little kid size! Super cute and of course, no laces to tie. Great Converse quality as usual. My only recommendation would be that the Converse rule of thumb for buying one size smaller does not really apply to this shoe, it seems to run truer to size than classic Chucks.
