Vox Footwear Trooper Relief
These were great shoes for an amazing price. My son doesn't skate, but that is the style he prefers. Unfortunately he is a size 14 and that size often is not carried in stores. So we went online and got these...quick delivery, great shoe, true fit. No funny colors/sparkles or weird shoe laces. Just black on black.
I bought these shoes for my 12 year old son. He loves them, they are true to size and very comfortable. I will purchase another pair in a different color when he needs a new pair of shoes.
