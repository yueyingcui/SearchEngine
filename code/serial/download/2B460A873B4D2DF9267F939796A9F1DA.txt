Nike Kids Dart 9 Lace (Toddler/Youth)
My 8-year old son LOVES these shoes... he was flying around the yard within minutes of putting them on. Definitely size up, we needed to a full size. Got the navy/gold and they look great!!
No extra bulk. Nice lightweight shoe. Fits true to size...we used a foot measuring device before ordering. I don't recommend them for an extra wide foot, but great for normal and maybe narrow. My son's feet are normal width. He is 5, these are his 1st Nikes, and he loves them. He usually wears DCs, but we bought these for PE Gym Class days at Kindergarten, but he actually wants to wear them every day instead of the DCs now.
