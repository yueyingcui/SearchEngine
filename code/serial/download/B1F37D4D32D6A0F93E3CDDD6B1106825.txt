Nike Shox Roadster+
Was very excited to have a style running shoe that wasn't crazy colors. The first pair I bought I had to return because it was at least 1/2 size too small. 2nd is that one shoe was fine, the other one of the front shocks is pushing way up into my arch on the outside. I wish I kept the box because I'd return them but I've already worn them a few times hoping they would break in, but they haven't. Look great, but hurt.
I love these shoes!  I ordered them in my usual size, but had to return them for a full size larger.  Other than that, they have been great.
The service was fast in receiving them once we placed an order. My husband loves these shoes. No store in our town had his size so this worked out perfect for us! Thanks!
I am a disabled vet with prostethics on both legs, therefore support and function is critical for me.  These shoes exceeded expectations and perform wonderfully.  In fact, I am so impressed that I am ordering them in other colors and would recommend them to anyone.  They did fit a bit snug compared to other size 14's I have, but not so much that I would buy a larger size.  However, if you are on the border of sizes, then you should certainly go for the larger.
