SKECHERS D'lites
I like these shoes so much that I bought four pairs. There is no break-in needed. I had bad plantar fasciitis and they were the shoes that I could wear when it got better. I have black and white. I have not used the black yet, but plan to take them for foreign travel so they do not show the dirt. I bought size 9Â½ when I usually buy size 9. I think the styling is fine. I am 66 years old.
Felt slightly smaller than most shoes in this size, but seemed to stretch out and get comfortable after a couple wearings. Good traction (I work in a slippery restaurant).
This is the second pair of Skechers D'Lites I have ordered and I like the style and the comfort of the shoes. I'm also happy to know that you all carry my size, which is hard for me to find.
Comfortable, light, true to size, good support - arches and soles.
These are by far the most comfortable sneakers that I have ever worn. They're lightweight and true to size. I bought two pairs one for back-up, and one for my vacation home. 

These shoes are great if you are on your feet like I am. The non-slip soles are a big plus. If you like a lot of arch support I would order a half size bigger and add an insole.
These are great shoes! Too cute! Soft comfortable feel, and true to size. Great for standing often; however, I would not recommend them for walking, jogging, or exercising on hard surfaces. They are just not supportive enough for that level of activity in my opinion. I did have to add inserts for a little extra support (but I do have bad knees).
