Pearl Izumi Streak II
Great except for one fatal flaw. The line of air holes along the bottom of the sole  catches stones of a precise size. I have to stop several times ever run to pop the out. 
Super-light and fast! Runs small, so order 1/2 to a full-size larger than normal.
Great shoe; light and responsive, a low (physical) profile, very comfortable fit, but light cushioning. Ran a little smaller than most brands, but typical for a Pearl Izumi shoe -- I typically wear a size 10 running shoe, but 10.5 works for this shoe, and could probably even push it to an 11. This shoe is great for those who want a slight barefoot feel, but with a little cushion and stability. Those who want more stability and cushioning should look at the PI synchrofloat. Only two small points -- the picture is representative, they are really green. Also, the sole has slight holes down the middle which are really good at capturing small stones. You don't feel them, but they might scratch some hardwood floors. Those aren't negative to me, but might be to some.
1/2 size small. I wear 11 dress shoe. 11-1/2 most running shoes, Nike Free size 12. I will need a 12 in these.
I love these shoes. They run a half size or a whole size small, so order up! I run barefoot in them, and have been for a year, and they do not chafe, they don't stink, and I never got a blister. They are very light, and great for racing. I think the only downside to these is that the "treads" wear out and wear low really quickly.
