Nike Musique IV
Best Zumba sneakers! I've been doing zumba for quite some time & have been trying to find a comfortable sneaker. I wore the Musique IV the last 2 nights for class & could not believe the difference from my prior shoes. They were very supportive, great ankle support, and so comfortable. I did go up a half size based on the recommendations from reviews, and would recommend that as well.
These are true to size, but out of the box they are very stiff and uncomfortable. I am a Nike girl and I am used to a little more flex and comfort in my Nike sneakers. I am hoping that they will break in a bit and fast!
Great for Zumba, after I broke them in. I found they are pretty much true to size. I only wish they came in a wide width. I can move a lot faster & pivot really well with these. All in all, I am very happy and I'll never go back to a regular sneaker for Zumba, after experiencing Zumba with these shoes!
Ordered half size larger (7.5) because my true size (7) was too tight. The larger size works perfectly. I am perfectly comfortable now at Zumba class
Nike stated to me that they had redesigned this shoe as customers, in the past, complained they were too small by a size. However, they are much narrower and shouldn't be stated that they are a medium (B) in width. After wearing Nikes for years, I will be trying another brand.
