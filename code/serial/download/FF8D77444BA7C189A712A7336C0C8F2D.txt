Mizuno 9-Spikeâ„¢ Finch 5 Low
My daughter has worn these cleats for the last 4 seasons. We just re-buy them in a larger size. She loves them.
I really love these cleats. I bought a pair of cheap cleats awhile ago and were only comfortable for 1 game so when I started playing doubleheaders my toes were toast. These cleats are very comfortable but I did have to buy 1 size up (normally a 6.5 and ended up getting a 7.5). Great for dirt or turf.
