Keds Champion-Canvas CVO
Cute and comfy - these have served me well for everything from summer barbecues to running errands. I wouldn't wear them to go hiking or anything, since there's not a whole lot of structure to them, but they are great for everyday situations and a nice break from heels. I would order a whole size down though, they seem to run quite large.
Curious problem with this shoe in navy. I have the black so decided on a navy pair. Order came but shoe looked like steel grey-blue, definitely not navy. Called customer service -- great as usual -- and asked for another pair to see if maybe mine was mismarked. One I got first made in Mexico. Second pair arrived, a little more navy looking but still mostly grey. This one made in China. But here's where it gets weird -- shoe -- in same size -- so big I could stick my finger behind my heels. And then when I searched for other brands in navy sneakers, the Keds version does not even appear under "navy" options. Keds has some quality control issues.
I love these shoes! They are a classic and very comfortable and true to size- a really fun summer shoe!
