Vans Chukka Boot Core Classics
These shoes feel very tight around the foot. I don't have very large feet or wide feet, but these shoes are tight like no other shoes I have owned in the same size. I have been wearing them for about a week with the hope that they will loosen up. I still hope they will get broken in with some time. I like the style of the shoe, but I am not impressed so far. I also second that these shoes make a squeaking sound when you walk. Not as in the bottoms squeak, but they squeak on the inside when your foot rubs against the inner walls.
You guys are phenomenal when it comes to deciding if we want to keep our shoes or not. Sometimes you need a bigger or smaller size shoe. Shipping is on tap!
First off, the service was fantastic! The shoes, which are hard to find in the first place, were in stock and delivered to my door 23 hours after placing the order, with free shipping! As to the shoes, they are basically a well made suede, dressier version of a Chuck Taylor. I can wear them at work in comfort and without ridicule. Not sized the same as Converse, though. Size 11 in Chuck Taylor shoes still has room for my toes, but size 11 1/2 Vans Chukka has my toes right up against the front. I normally wear 11 1/2 wide. I should have ordered size 12.
I purchased these Vans for my son. He absolutely loves them. They are very comfortable and true to size. Just remember they are white. All kidding aside he is very happy with them
