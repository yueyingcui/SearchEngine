SKECHERS GOwalk
Would have been a comfortable fit. The length was at least a half size short for my feet which are at the edge of a standard shoe length. My wife has a pair and loves them.
I bought these shoes to wear on vacation. I wore them everywhere. Very comfortable shoe, true to size. I wish I would have ordered a wide - a little snug, but not too bad. I would buy this shoe again.
Very cute and comfortable, but am returning for 1/2 size larger. I have a wide foot and high arch.
These shoes are cute! They are also very comfortable. Every pair of Skecher shoes I've owned has run about a half size small.

So light; so comfy; order your regular size and you'll be happy. Like wearing slippers!
I'm always looking for comfortable walking shoes that dont look like sneakers - the black suede is perfect. In fact, they are so comfortable and light I purchased 2 pairs and plan to put one away. For me the suede version is true to size but I bought them at the end of a hot day and wear flip flops all the time in summer. IMO the cloth version feels a little shorter. These are definitely worth a try!
Love these shoes. They do not run large on me - if anything they are a smidge shorter than the usual Skechers size 6 but the toe box is roomy so it's okay. So light and very cushy. I have narrow ankles and they work great for me - no rubbing without socks. I got the gray - great neutral. Wish they came in tan or brown.
