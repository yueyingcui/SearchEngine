K-Swiss The Classicâ„¢
My husband likes this style of shoe. The shoes run true to size and great quality.
So far so good. I read another previous poster that said his shoes were a size too small. My normal size for shoes is 10 1/2 and EE. I ordered the size 11 and EEE. They are just right.

Sorry, but I have other K-Swiss shoes that are the same style, size and width that fit. For some reason these are too narrow. Very disappointed.
