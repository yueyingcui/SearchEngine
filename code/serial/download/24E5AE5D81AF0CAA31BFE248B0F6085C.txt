Nike Kids Dart 9 (Infant/Toddler)
Very cute and comfortable shoes! I'm not sure if Nike runs larger or Pedipeds and Circo (Target brand) runs smaller but my son grew out of his size 5's in pediped but wears these in size 5 well. The mouth of the shoe opens wide so its easy to place their foot in it. The color is exactly as pictured. I'm very happy with this shoe. I would recommend for a little more experienced walker. I think think sole's make it hard for brand new walkers to walk.
These shoes look great on my toddler son's feet and they fit great too. True to size and they're very lightweight. I have a hard time with shoes that are too 'clunky' for him and these are perfect - he really seems to walk (and run) well in them!
