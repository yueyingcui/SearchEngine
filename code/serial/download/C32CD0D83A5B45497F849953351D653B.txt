Avia A1516M
A very lightweight and comfortable sneaker. I had to buy a size 1/2 larger than normal before it fit properly. I had to change the laces since they were too long.
Surprisingly good shoe for the price. A little bland on the eyes, but very light and comfortable to wear. I am not a runner and am not sure how this would stand up under that type of use, but for every day sneakers for a good sized, active guy (6'2", 215 lbs.) these have held up very well.
