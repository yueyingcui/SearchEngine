New Balance WW01
I LOVE these shoes! I've been on the hunt for stylish tennis shoes that I can wear with jeans or other casual outfits. My boyfriend spotted these on a running store employee last week who raved about them, but told him they don't sell them in stores. They are true to size (I'm a 10 who wears a 10.5 in running shoes) and these fit great. Lightweight, flexible and adorable!
Love these! I think it's great that they're so eco-friendly and look so good! Nice color combo. They're super lightweight and easy to walk in. I would say they run a tiny bit small, but not an actual half size small. I have a somewhat wider foot, that might be part of the problem. But anyway, overall I really like these for an on-the-go type of street style active shoe.
