Nurse Mates Louise
I am on my feet quite a bit of the day whether I'm walking or just standing a lot and am always looking for comfort in shoes. I needed a black pair of shoes with some support and cushion and decided to try a pair of Nurse Mates shoes. I am very satisfied with them and they seem to be true to size. I tried a slip on also, but they ran very large in size so I returned them for an oxford instead.
These are the best.
It took 3 times to get my right fit but there was no problem returning or anything. After wearing these for a few days, it was like wearing bedroom slippers but with support. They are sooooo comfortable. Have deformed feet. RA & when younger had one squashed ---- so I do have a problem finding something that's even halfway comfortable. And these are the greatest. I think they do run about a 1/2 size small in length. Or maybe it's just my feet. They don't look bad either.

Runs 1/2 size large - 
These shoes have that spongy sole like the Quark Quarky, and the insole is the same. However, the back of the shoe rubs at the rim (why do shoemakers make two pointy peaks at the back of the shoe???!!!). Also, it runs big. Alas, I wanted the shoe to work...Maybe a second generation of the same style will work better...
