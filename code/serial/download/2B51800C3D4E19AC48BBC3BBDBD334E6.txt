Nike View III
These shoes are awesome - they fit well, very comfortable - they were true to size. I was told to order a half size larger and I did - ended up sending back and getting my exact size!
I am an over the road truck driver. I need shoes than can stand up to constant wear, provide excellent comfort, and look as professional as tennis shoes can look. Previously I had been purchasing Avia 325 walking shoes from JCPenney's which were great shoes with non-slip soles but the outsole would separate from the midsole. I had several pairs do this so I decided to try different shoes. I am a big fan of Nike shoes for their style and quality so I decided to try these shoes. They are very attractive, and the fit and comfort could not be better. These shoes are just what the doctor ordered! If you are looking for comfortable, well made, all black walking shoes, look no further. This is as good as it gets! And the price simply cannot be beat! On a side note: I wear 9W shoes. When I cannot find 9W I buy a 9½D. When I saw the Extra Wide option on these shoes I shied away from the wide and went with the 9½D. While writing this review, I brought up the Avia shoe from JCPenney's and found that the shoes that I had been buying was a 9 Extra Wide (4E). When I replace these shoes it will be with another pair but in the correct size.
Nice but moderate construction and 1/2 size smaller than advertised. Order 1/2 size larger.
