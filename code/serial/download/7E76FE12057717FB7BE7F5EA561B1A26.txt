Keen Kids Coronado Lace (Youth)
Size 4 was way too big with my son's foot sliding forward and backward, and size 3 was too small with his big toe hitting the end of the shoe. Unfortunately Keen doesn't carry 1/2 sizes, so none were just right.
Nice shoe. Lightweight, good fabric. True to advertisement. Only no 1/2 sizes. My son has to grow into them.
A great shoe - 
As an adult who wears children's sizes, I love these shoes. They do run small. I was able to wear my regular size in my Keen slippers. Needed to go up a size in this style of Keen.

My son loved these shoes on the website and in person, but they run pretty small! He told me they fit b/c he got the largest size they offer (the size he would normally wear) and he really wanted to keep them. I thought they looked way too small, but I let him keep them. He wore them 2 days to school and couldn't take it any more b/c they were so uncomfortable. When I held him up to his Hush Puppies that were supposedly the same size, they looked a whole size smaller.
