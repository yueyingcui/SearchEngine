New Balance Kids KJ689 (Toddler/Youth)
Pros, these shoes fit my son's wide foot which is a difficult thing to do and usually requires online purchase. There aren't many wide tennis shoe manufacturers out there for kids. Cons, they burst apart at the forefoot within 2 months like every other tennis shoe I have tried over the years. Not durable at all for an 11 year old boy who is very active. I suspect New Balance, and every other major shoe manufacturer of kid's tennis shoes, knows this, but they also know you need to have tennis shoes...so they sell an inferior albeit cosmetically appealing product that will not last because they can then sell 4 pairs per year instead of one or two. I cannot wait until he gets into an adult size so I can buy a more durable shoe. When I think of all the money I have spent on these flimsy shoes because I had no other choice over the years, it really frustrates! I try to rationalize the expense because I am not spending money on makeup and bath products like I do for his teenage sisters so the overall cost is the same per child!
Thank you New Balance for making wide sizes for kids!! My daughter no longer complains that the shoe is "cutting into foot." The fit is great and the style good enough, although more "girlie" colors would appeal to younger girls.
My 4 year daughter LOVES these shoes! Like most New Balance, they run a little short, so I ordered a 1/2 size larger and they fit perfectly with some room to grow!
I am an adult with a small foot. Love this shoe. I wear them everywhere. I even bought an extra pair. True to size.
