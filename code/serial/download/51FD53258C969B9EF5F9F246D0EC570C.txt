Nike Kids T-Run 3 ALT (Infant/Toddler)
Nike T-Run 3 Alt and Nike Darts have been my go-to sneakers for my kids since they were toddlers.  My 2 year old is wearing these now.  Good support, very durable.  They do run small, as I have found most kids' Nike sneakers do.  Go up a half size.
These are pretty much the only shoes our 2 year old wears. We love them! Easy on and off, but still a secure fit. Our daughter has pretty narrow skinny legs and feet & they are a good fit. We will continue to buy this style when she grows out of her current size.
Cute, lightweight, comfortable, and properly sized. Very happy with product.
It is a great snicker. It's very comfortable good support. Perfect for school. True to size. I bought 3 pairs. :)
