Sanuk Hey Jute
WALKING ON AIR - 
These shoes are without a doubt the most comfortable shoes I have ever experienced and at age 56, I've been through a lot of shoes. I wear them almost everywhere. Wish I could wear them to work. I might try that one day! I would also like the Sanuk SUV but it doesn't come in size 13. Hey Jute's are great, you will not be disappointed!
