New Balance MX871
Ordered 1/2 size larger than my other NB's and were a little tight. Ordering 1 full size larger now and will see if improved.   Liked the feel and construction but definitely not ankle stable. 
Purchased my usual New Balance size, but when it arrived, was too small.   Went up 1/2 size and perfect.  Comfortable, good cushioning, offers stability for lateral movements.
Shoes are very light and comfortable. They have great traction, I use them for racquetball and they are great. They run a little small I had to return and get a half size larger but I'm glad I got them.
I am a podiatrist and bought these shoes for the lateral stability required for P90X.  I had to return them because they run a half size small.  I'm typically a 9.5 but have to go to a 10.  Ideally you should have a thumb width of room from the tip of your longest toe to the end of the shoe and be able to freely wiggle your toes.  I also think the ankle support is mediocre since the heel counter is cut very low, thus not ideally supporting the lateral collateral nor deltoid ankle ligaments.  This is a light and versatile shoe with all the bulk trimmed away.  It is not a highly cushioned shoe like a runner but for fast footwork requirements I think it passes.  Oh, and it looks sharp!
Runs on the small side so I had to order 1/2 size larger than Asics but same as Adidas. Comfortable right out of the box.  Great all-purpose cross trainer.  I even play golf in them.
