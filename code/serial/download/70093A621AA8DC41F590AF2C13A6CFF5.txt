Always love Vivo shoes! They are as close to going barefoot as I can get in the workplace.  Amazingly comfortable! Instantly felt great didn't need to be worn in. I needed black shoes for a job that has me on my feet all day. These ended up looking more feminine and cute than I thought they would with the wide toe box. I'm usually a 7 and a half but I wear 8 in this brand so heads up! Buy a size up!
I love the style of these shoes but somehow that size 10 looked like it was made for someone with 7 toes or webbed feet.
Have had these for a while and they're my go-to shoe if I need to wear something without socks. I didn't have the issues others mentioned with strap or heel rubbing, perhaps because I run with 'minimalist' shoes so my feet are used to this. They're simple and so comfortable I can walk in them all day - something I don't dare do in my "cuter" traditional but narrower flats. I size as a 6-6.5 but prefer a 7 so my foot doesn't feel squeezed into the shoe; these are similar so I'd order 1/2-1 size up.
These are cute, simple shoes, and very comfortable. For me, however, they were WAY too wide on my feet, especially at the ball of the foot. There is quite a lot of room to spare in there. I'd also suggest ordering a half size down if you're not planning on wearing socks. Wish these worked, but yet another pair of basic black flats is going back - the search continues.
