TIC TAC TOES Chadwick
I purchased these for my husband. Have been dancing for one year, and it was time to get serious about shoes. I ordered 3 pair for him to try on (different sizes, styles). These fit beautifully and felt/looked more like a man's shoe (not wimpy like so many men's dance shoes). Typically a size 12, he went down to a 11-1/2, since they should fit snug.
Street shoe size is the way to go on this one. Great cushioning. Flexible and comfortable. 

I have been taking dance lessons and social dancing for eight years, and have used mens dress shoes with leather soles the entire time. I have tried on dance shoes sold by vendors at dance conventions, but they were not padded and uncomfortable. This is my first pair of dance shoes, and they are well padded, lightweight and extremely comfortable. They are also very good looking. The fit is true to size, and they are fantastic to dance in. I am extremely well pleased and would purchase them again. They are also manufactured in the USA which is a hard commodity to find anymore.
Nice shoes - 
I am pleased with this shoe, I need a wide shoe and this one is true to size. I also am able to wear a fuller sock since the shoe is just a little loose. The shoe looks good as well.
