Nike Air Pegasus+ 29
Feels like it is a great shoe; I run only in Air Pegasus. This one seems to run a bit small, so go up a half size when you order.
Color is way more neon / glow in the dark looking in person. But very fun! Also, this Air Pegasus runs a bit small. I'd recommend ordering a half size to a whole size up depending on how thick your socks are.
