Saucony PowerGridâ„¢ Hurricane 14
I am a Registered Nurse and make a living on my feet. I have been wearing Saucony ProGrid Hurricaines since the 9 came out. They have always had excellent arch support and over pronation control. Until they just changed from ProGrid to PowerGrid (14) they have been true to size, but this one seems 1/2 size too large.
I have worn Hurricanes, Stabils, Omnis, and Kayanos. These are by far the best out of the group. Hurricane finally has perfect combination of stability, cushion, fit and lightness that is rare in stability shoes. The run exactly true to size. I am sorry to see my love affair with Kayano go, but Saucony and the Massachusetts team nailed it! Great job!
Good,slightly minimal running shoe. Normally can wear a medium width running shoe but needed the wide in this one. Normally wear a size 8 1/2 but though I kept it, a size 9 would have been better.
