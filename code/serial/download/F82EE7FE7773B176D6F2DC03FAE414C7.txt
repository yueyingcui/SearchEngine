New Balance Kids KV990P (Toddler/Youth)
My sons love them, I bought 1 pair for each one. They are comfy, nice and easy to put on. The size was okay but at first, I returned them (both of them) because they felt narrower, and I ordered same size wide..and then, they fit perfect.
Great sneaker for my little guy. I like New Balance because they offer full range of sizes (including wide width) and good support. 
The New Balance brand was recommended to me by a podiatrist for my son's wide feet. The normal/medium width was plenty wide for him. Felt true to size in length as well.
