Nike Premier III FG
I bought these cleats for my 12 1/2 year old daughter.  She plays soccer 3-4 times/week.  She loves these shoes and said they are very comfortable.  She wears a ladies size 9.  She finds the Nike sports shoes the most comfortable brand.
They are very great quality. The service was quick and easy. I liked the communication via e-mails on how you guys kept me posted. I also had to make a return because one size didn't fit and you guys were all so helpful. 
Watch out! These run very small. I am usually a size 6Â½ or 7 women's and the 7 was so small that after an hour of practice I thought my toes were going to split in half. Great cleats, but order a size up!
