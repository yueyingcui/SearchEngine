ASICS Gel-TRXÂ®
I just bought these for my hospital clinicals after a podiatrist told me to ditch my nursing clogs that were worsening the arthritis in my feet apparently. It is hard to find all white leather shoes in a womens 11, so she suggested I buy a mens shoe. I have been pleasantly surprised by the fit! I moved up in size years ago for width, but since a mens shoes is wider, I was able to buy my true size and I felt more stable on my feet in the operating room! That was a huge plus! I did need to add arch supports, but I find that to be in any sneakers I buy.
I have found this shoe to be an excellent walking shoe.  The Gel-TRX truly craddles and holds your foot securely, including your heel.  Being cushioned as it is, it is a joy to wear and will stand up to the abuse of long distance walking.  For casual wear, it's a dream.  I have found that I have to order one size larger than I normally wear for a proper fit, but the width of the shoe is true.
I am a huge Asics fan. Their size 10.5 always fits me perfect. This shoe is a little more snug at first, but loosens a bit. Thin poly socks are a must for me on this as well as all other Asics athletic shoes. This is my new work shoe, replacing Asics Cumulus. Most notably, this shoe is more stable. I find the true running shoes to be better all-day walkers, but this is still comfy and the stability is welcome. The understated, classy look is nice as well.
Great shoes. I've found that this cross trainer series has worked very well for me--started with the 150's, then the 160's, then this. Would like some more color options, but great shoes, nonetheless. I ordered a half-size larger for best fit.
These a great shoes to go with anything a little girl could wear. Easy to dress up or down. Plus, the free lip gloss was a true hit! We did go up a size.
