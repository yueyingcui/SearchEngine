Vans Michoacan
I got the Khaki color but it is more of greenish tan color than sand/brown color shown in pictures. The brown color where the lace holes are much more lighter faded brown than in pictures. And I thought this was like a slip on shoes but you actually have to tie the laces. Feels true to size; I wear 8 in most of shoes and it fits right on.
I purchased this these because I wanted a casual shoes. I was skeptical at first if they were going to fit because my shoe size varies from brand to brand. Thankfully they did. Have to say beware when you first try them on if you have wide feet (like me), they feel a bit snug. Give them time, by the end of the first day I wore them they fit me perfectly.
