Nike Kids Jr Nike5 Elastico (Toddler/Youth)
Love these! Bought them for my 5 year old daughter to wear to school, who is all about soccer. The louder the shoe, the happier she is. These are by far the best looking shoes that she has owned. She was ecstatic when she opened the box. These run true to size. She is right at an 11 when we measured her foot before ordering these. The 11 fits perfect!
Nike shoes run very true to size and have always been a good fit for my son. He is now 11 and has been wearing Nike sneakers and sports shoes for five years. He wears these shoes for indoor soccer play on turf with rubber pellets. Even though he is happy with the shoes, he does seem to slip a lot while trying to make quick moves. These shoes have a flat bottom, but I think something with a little more texture for gripping would be better. Everything else is great.

These are actually a Christmas gift for my youngest son, so he hasn't worn them yet.  He wanted them because my older son already has them and loves them.  They are very comfortable, my son wears them for his indoor soccer season and also to school on a daily basis.  The fit is a bit snug.  I would order a half size up.  They are holding up beautifully.  Would highly recommend these indoor cleats and I know my younger son will love them too.
I wear a women's size 7.5 shoe and the kids 5.5 fit well.  It might be a little tight if you are closer to a size 8.  The pink is much more neon than it shows and it is all the same shade of pink.  These are supposed to be an indoor soccer shoe but they are great to just wear around.
