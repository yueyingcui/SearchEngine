Zoot Sports Ultra Race 3.0
This is my second pair of Zoot Ultras. They are definitely half a size smaller than my others of the same size. While I am sticking with Zoot for comfort and lack of tongue/laces I am really bummed that I paid so much for shoes that I cannot really run in. I did not notice the difference until I went for a run.
