adidas Outdoor Super Hiking Karak GTX
Just got my new Super Hikers and must return them. They are about 1/2 size too big.
I ordered the size I would normally. They were a full size too big. Upon getting the smaller size, they still produced very little comfort. They look nice and are quite stylish, but very uncomfortable. With a small crack developing at the front bend, and only a month of normal wear, durability does seem to be an issue. Would not recommend.
