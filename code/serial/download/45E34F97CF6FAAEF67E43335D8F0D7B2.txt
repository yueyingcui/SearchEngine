Vans Kids Slip-On Lo Pro (Toddler/Youth)
Great looking shoe. Fits a whole size bigger as is the case for all Vans we've purchased. Only complaint is that the sparkles fall off. We had to clean the toe area a bit and many came away.
I fully agree with size issue on these shoes. I ordered size my daughter normally wears plus one size smaller. I'm now ordering an even smaller size which I think will work. Other than that my daughter loves them and they're just as cute in person!
