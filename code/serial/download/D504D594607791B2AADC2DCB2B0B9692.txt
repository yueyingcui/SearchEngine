Avia A115M
Very happy with this purchase. Comfortable, sized right and seem to provide a lot of support for mixed athletic activities.
I have been wearing Avia for over 20 years, they provide me with needed support, to correct a disability. I highly recommend them. My only problem is that I cannot seem to be able to find the correct size anymore. I need men's 7EEEE, which are difficult to locate.
