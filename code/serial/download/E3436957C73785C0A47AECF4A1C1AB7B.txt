ASICS GEL-Naomi 2â„¢
Great for Zumba! Asics is my favorite brand of running shoe, and now they have a shoe for Zumba. As I always do with Asics, I ordered a 1/2 size up from a normal size.

I ordered a size 7, but the shoe felt snug on my toes. I returned them for an 8 and had some room to spare for my toes. However, the main problem was the width of the shoe. They felt really tight on my foot. The bottom support felt nice, but I had to return them because they were not wide enough (and I don't have abnormally wide feet). 

Love the design. Just fit too tight. I always wear an 8M, and this shoe was tight! I'm trying a half size up, but I'm not sure if it will solve the tightness issue because it wasn't too short.

I bought these for weight training but they are actually very comfortable to run in as well. I can always count on Asics. I bought these in a 10 and a half and they fit like a dream. They fit true to size for me - I usually wear a 10 1/2 or 11 in these and and 11 would have had too much toe room. So that is a personal choice in my opinion whether you want more or not.
Fabulous shoe for Zumba! Perfect fit. Feels great on my feet. The size and width were right on. I read a review about this shoe in the NY Times as the perfect Zumba shoe and ordered it, just to see. I am so happy with this shoe.
