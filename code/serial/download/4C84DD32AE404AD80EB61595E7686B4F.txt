The North Face Men's Ultra 50
The 50k is supportive and cushioned, I have about 40 miles so far in these shoes and I would recommend them. I typically run in the Salomon XT Wings as I need the support but these feel just as supportive and it seems as though the cushioning will be more resilient than the XTs. I typically wear a size 13 but the 12Â½ fit perfect, as I always believe most TNF shoes run about half a size large. Now I just wish TNF would come out with a goretex version.
