Vans Authenticâ„¢
I own 4 pairs of Vans, and these are by far the coolest color of all. They're comfy, can be dressed up and certainly down, and fit true to size. I usually wear a wider shoe, and these Vans Authentics fit really well despite that. Take the color bleeding warning seriously: if these go in the rain or wet grass before getting a coat of Scotchgard, they will run/bleed. Keep them beautiful with a bit of prep and they'll last you forever.
These Vans are blue. Like, Blue. Electric cerulean technicolor blue. I bought 'em half a size down to wear without socks...they work perfect for those summer Fridays where you want to wear your trousers rolled (whatup J. Alfred Prufrock) and go to work looking like a guy who can pull off blue Vans. Because you can, buddy, you certainly can.
These shoes are awesome! I love the style. I got the methyl blue and I have to say people are giving me compliments about these shoes. I also have to say they run true size. They also make good gifts.
I love these shoes. I bought them for my daughter and they are better in person. We ordered half a size down and they are perfect.
The colors do not seem as vivid as the picture, however the style has come on with other bright neon! Not yet worn by him so can't give a full size review.
