adidas Originals Superstar 2 W
I usually wear a size 8 - 8 1/2, So based on some people saying they felt 1/2 size bigger, I went with the size 8's. They were huge, and I had to return them. But returning them was easy. 
The shoes are very cute though.
I bought these to replace a pair that I bought years ago. Glad they are keeping the style the same while still making some fun color options. They ran a half size large in my opinion and they definitely are wider than normal sneakers. I don't plan on wearing them for anything but recreation so it isn't an issue.

Superstar 2W in lavender - 
Very cute but runs small and narrow; next time I will order up a size.
