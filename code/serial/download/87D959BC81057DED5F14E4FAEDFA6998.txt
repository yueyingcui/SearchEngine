New Balance Classics U420
True to size, maybe a bit long, but mostly just narrow. Not a ton of support but lots of compliments to make up for it. Very cool shoe. 
These shoes are OK, but not really that great of arch support though. They are true to size and comfortable enough.
Great shoe for a great price - 
When I purchased this shoe, I heard they ran small, so I bought a size 10 when I usually wear a size 11. At first they were quite tight and I was worried I'd have to send them back. Luckily, they broke in perfectly, and now fit exactly how I wanted them to.
Satisfactory - 
More nylon than the photo depicts. Design doesn't scale too well to the larger sizes, which is a common problem with shoes. Somewhat flimsy sides, but the sole is firm and supportive. More canvas would be nice for the price.
Comfortable and Stylish - 
This shoe is everything I had hoped for. I saw a few posts about the sizing being off so I ordered a half size down (size 11) and it fits just fine. I definitely couldn't have gone 1 full size.

Multiversals review - 
These shoes run a size bigger than normal and will break in nicely. I wear a 14 but the 13 fit perfect after they were broken in. they are extremely light weight and comfortable. I have a high arch and the center support is just not there. Nothing that an insole couldn't cure.

Shoes ordered down and half size. Comfortable but no support at all so added an insole and now they are great.

Awesome - Love my 420s. Not much arch support, but very comfortable for knocking around town, wearing to work (I'm a hairstylist), and hip enough to wear to concerts. The size runs a full size larger, however. I am an 8.5 and needed to return them for a 7.5, which fit perfectly.
