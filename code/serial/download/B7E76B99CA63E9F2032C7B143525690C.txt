Nike Field Trainer Textile
I have thin feet and these are very snug. I am usually a 10Â½, I would order an 11 next time. They are still comfortable despite being a little small. They look even better than I expected. I wish they had more color options, I would order the same shoe in half a size bigger. They are not much for traction, though.
Great shoe, runs a little snug with thick socks on, but I love the shoe, great design and style, they were out of my size 13 so i purchased the size 14 and they still fit good in fact I'm glad I got the size I got. These shoes run just a little narrow but overall great.
