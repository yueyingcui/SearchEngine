Vans Slip-On Lo Pro
Just want to note that the "washed black" color is far more gray than black. I would have preferred black, as it appears in the picture, but when they arrived I reasoned that I could always use another pair of sneakers and decided to keep them. As with my other low-pros, comfortable, cute, true to size.
I ordered an 8, usually wear a 7 1/2, they were too big. Now trying one size down. Love the shoe!
These shoes are pretty sweet. No complaints so far. If you're like me, and you sometimes wear one size in one brand, and one size in another (I either wear a 7 1/2 or an 8 depending on the shoe), I would err on the larger of the sizes. But they fit pretty good, comfortable. I'd buy another pair.
Great shoe, true to size, comfortable (after a day of breaking in). My only complaint is that after a lot of wear, the rubber on the sides starts to peel from the shoe. 
Runs about a half size small. Super cute on. I receive complements whenever I wear them.
