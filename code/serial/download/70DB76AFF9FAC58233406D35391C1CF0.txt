Nike Kids Lunarglide 3 (Youth)
My son is a size 4 in Reebok Realflex, I got these in a 5 and they didn't fit, we were disappointed in the color too, the shoe looks pink and gray in person instead of red.
I got the blue shoes in a size 6 and a size 7 for my 11 and 12 year old sons. They both love them. They love the color and style, and wear them all the time. There are no problems as of yet with anything wearing out (I have only had them for a couple of months.) They both say they are comfortable for walking, running, bike riding, whatever they are doing.
If you are buying for a boy - beware! The grey/"siren red" combo is not red, but instead a very bright hot pink. They also run narrow(er) than Reeboks. 12 year old currently wearing a size 6 in Reeboks and the 6 1/2 Nike was too tight. Also, the plastic/nylon mesh on the side seems like it could rip very easily. Going back!
Cute shoes.  My daughter loves them. Fit is true to size.
These shoes are amazing.I bought them for my 12 year old daughter and she loved them! They are a tad bit big so I would recommend a half size smaller then what you are planning to buy. But other than that they are fantastic!
Bought these at our local kids shoe store for my 12 year old in a size 5; which also fits my 6.5 adult foot. Since I tried them on, I was also able to notice how comfortable and extremely lightweight they are. My daughter loves them. I do think they are over priced, but they were really the best shoe (for support and comfort) and for the price difference, I'd rather her more comfortable.
