Nike Kids Sweet Classic (Toddler/Youth)
We just got these shoes.  They seem to run really big for Nikes.  We ordered a 2 1/2 in these and in a pair of soccer cleats.  These were huge; the cleats fit great.  These were the same size as my other son's size 5 DC sneakers in the same order.  We'll reorder a smaller size.
This is a well-constructed shoe.  It fits true to size.  I have wiped them down with a damp cloth when they were lightly soiled and they look good as new!  A very good value for a fantastic shoe!
Great shoe but to me they ran a little small. I wear a size 5Y and that's what I ordered. They were a little on the tight side so I gave them to my daughter. I would suggest ordering a half size larger.
too big - 

These shoes are a really cool looking alternative to the original canvas converse all stars. They have the softness and comfort of a leather shoe versus the canvas of converse which has no support. My son has always bugged me for converse but i felt there was no support any where within the shoe. When  I found these, I was more receptive due tho the leather and comfort of the footbed. Only downsize is the shoe runs quite big, maybe a 1/2 - 1 size.
