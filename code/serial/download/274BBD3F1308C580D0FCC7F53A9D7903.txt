adidas Kids adiFast AC I (Toddler)
These shoes are so stylish!  My husband and I loved them!  They seemed true to size, however, they were too narrow and they don't come in wides.  It seems to be the same way with the adult adidas shoes.  It's so hard to find any toddler shoes in Wide sizes.  You always have to buy name brand, online, and the selection is slim.  Hey, shoe manufacturers...Baby/Toddler feet are usually chunky, they need wides!
