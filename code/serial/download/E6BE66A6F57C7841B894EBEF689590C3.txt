PUMA El Rey Slip-on Stripes Wn's
I like those sneakers, they are very comfortable. You cannot wear them with socks though and the top is really tight with the leather. I advise you to get a size bigger. Other than that they are perfect. I am actually thinking of getting another pair in white.
These are so cute! But sadly, I had to return them. They are impossible to get on. I do not know if it is because of my high arch or what, but there is not a lot of room in the vamp. The darker stripe looks like it is Velcro, but there is a teeny-weeny elastic gore with about Â½" of give. I ordered my Puma size which is half a size larger than my usual size. The length was great, look was great. They were just impossible to get on and very uncomfortable. These went right back, as much as I hated to do it.
For anyone without foot problems, this is the perfect shoe. Great scores in style, cushy comfort, and look. I was sad to return these because even though they did fit my orthotics (I get a .5 a size larger typically to do this) the soft canvas on the sides did not provide the support it needed to make it effective. Very sad to return these.
