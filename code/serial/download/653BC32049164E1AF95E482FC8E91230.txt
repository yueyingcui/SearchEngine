DC Kids Dodgy Backpack
Very cute - but sized for a kindergartner. You really can't fit anything more than a one-subject notebook and a lunch box. Quality does not seem high either - fabric feels flimsy and zippers seem cheap. I do not think it would hold up to the use of a grade school kid for very long. I'm returning it anyway.
