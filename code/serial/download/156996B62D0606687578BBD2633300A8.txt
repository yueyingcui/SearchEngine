New Balance WC1005
This is a follow-up review. At first I really loved these shoes but after a few weeks of playing tennis in them I found one of the support straps that run from the sole to the laces presses into one of my foot bones. Also, the lack of stability and arch support caught up with me. Even with aftermarket insoles and thick socks, I can't wear them. Nice shoe but they didn't work for me. If you go with these shoes, order 1/2 size down.
These are my favorite tennis shoes. I always go up a half size when I buy New Balance.
Very comfortable tennis shoe.  Great support, runs true to size and great overall fit.  I would expect nothing less from New Balance, they always make a great shoe.
I wear a 6 wide, hard to find. Many other brands run narrow and don't even offer wide in small sizes. New Balance runs already full, and when I order the Wide it gives me the needed room. The fabric breathes enough for my sweaty feet to stay comfortable for hours on a hot court. I always insert my own orthotics (very high arches) into sneakers so that arch support combined with the good shoe construction gives both feet and ankles the stability I want. Pricey but you get what you pay for, and after I had a serious ankle strain 3 years ago I am not messing around with anything that doesn't offer optimal support and stability. My last pair were the previous NB equivalent style lasting 2 heavily used seasons and loved them.
Just got these and they are wonderful. Plenty of room in the toe box and lots of cushion. But the main reason I purchased this particular shoe is because I need stability - these certainly give it. I'm very happy with these and would buy them again. I went up 1/2 size from my normal shoe size, but I do tend to need to go up in any sneaker.
