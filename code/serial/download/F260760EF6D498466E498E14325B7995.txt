I love the shoes! I am currently in a musical. Purchasing the shoes one week before opening night, not very smart. But the shoes turned out to fit like a glove. Yaaa! My feet are fairly narrow so I picked the narrow and exact shoe size.
These shoes are so great! They are true to size, feel extremely comfortable and look wonderful. I think that dancing is easier with them on!
Awesome shoes. They are great for dancing, look pretty stylish for this type of dancing shoe and they fit true to size. 

I bought this show for my daughter to wear in her high school musical performances. She says it is very comfortable and fits true to size. Like the non slip bottom.
Excellent dance shoe!  I have a wide foot and this is the first shoe that fit true to size and width. Comfortable right out of the box, no break in period needed. Heel is stable and the height is perfect.   
Such a beautiful shoe, but, alas, it runs quite large. I had to return it and there were none in the next smaller size. Sigh.
