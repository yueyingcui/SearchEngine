Nike Action Kids Mogan 3 (Infant/Toddler)
I bought these shoes in a toddler size 9 for my 2 1/2 year old. They are a bit hard to slide his wide feet into but once on, he seems to enjoy them. The sole is not very flexible. I would prefer a more flexible shoe for him next time. The white canvas material is also hard to clean. He's had these shoes for 1 week and the white material is starting the turn grey from playing in the sandbox at preschool. Other than that, the shoes are very cute.
My son loves these. He picked them out himself and he loves the blue color. They will be great for school, as that is what we got them for. Nike shoes always seem to run a bit small. We got half a size up!
