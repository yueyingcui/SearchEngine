Frye Sully Boat
These are pretty nice looking.  Have received compliments on them.  I ordered down a half size as I figured I would be wearing without socks and they would stretch, but i should have just ordered my regular size, as they still feel a little tight after several months of wear.  
Ordered a 10 and 10.5.  I didnt feel there was much of a difference between the two.  I ended up deciding 10 was the best fit, which is my size in most other shoes.  So I would say these shoes are true to size.  The colors are awesome.  Unfortunately, both pairs are being sent back.  The 10 had a defect in the stitching that I could not get past, especially considering the price.  Seems like a pretty well made shoe otherwise.  Also, I am very disappointed that these are made in China.  I thought all Frye's were made in USA or Mexico. Guess not.  At this price, they should be.  Even without the defect, I probably would have sent these back after discovering where they were made. Buy American.
This shoe is good quality, has a very comfortable fit, and looks great. I would order half a size down, I usually wear 9Â½ but a 9 fit better. This is the best boat shoe for your money. I have tried Sebago, Sperry and Steve Madden boat shoes and returned them all.
Absolutely beautiful boat shoe.  The leather is substantial but really soft. They run a little long, maybe half a size or so.  
Great shoes! Very stylish boat shoe - toe is just a bit more rounded than a Sperry Top-Sider (which I also own and love). Ran a tad small, I usually wear a size 10 in Frye boots and shoes; swapped for a 10.5, which fits perfect for me. I'd recommend going a half-size larger.
