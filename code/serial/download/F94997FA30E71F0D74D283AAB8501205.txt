Vivobarefoot Legacy L 
I'm constantly on the lookout for the "perfect" shoe in terms of comfort. Having had back surgery at the age of 24, comfort is by far the most important factor when buying shoes. I took a chance by trying these, and I love them, even after spending all day on my feet. I ordered a 1/2 size up from what I normally wear, and they felt perfect. I hope they last a long time.
