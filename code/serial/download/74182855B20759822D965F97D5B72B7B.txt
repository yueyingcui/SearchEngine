SIDI Genius 5 Pro Carbon	
These are great cycling shoes. I got the max size so I could wear my insert. I like the upper strap being separate, so I can get the top tighter than the toes.
Great shoe! I normally wear 11EEE width and the shoe fit my foot perfectly. Perhaps a tad bit long but this didn't seem to be an issue. Something to do with the European size. First pair of cleats that I have owned. Did a 300+ mile road trip the second week of owning the shoes and they performed great. Dried quickly after a couple of summer thunderstorms. No cramping or forefoot problems.
Shoe runs smaller and narrower than indicated. I like that it is narrower because I need that. Had to go up a 1/2-size. Otherwise, it is a light and great fitting shoe.
