PUMA King Top DI FG
I've been playing soccer for over 35 years and have worn a variety of pro level outdoor firm ground (FG) shoes ranging from Adidas, Diadora, Kelme, Patrick, Pony and Puma. The Puma King Top DI FG by far, was/is the better shoe. This is my second pair. The fit and feel are outstanding and the soft kangaroo leather makes the shoes feel like they were broken-in at the factory. The quilted toe box gives you exceptional touch and control of the ball. The fairly large "old school" fold over tongue not only gives the shoe a clean, classic look but does a great job in hiding the laces - especially the knot. I highly recommend these shoes. Please note that I had to go a 1/2 size larger than I normally wear (10 v. 9.5). FYI - these shoes were worn (for many years) by such great players as Pele, Maradona and Peter Shilton (to name but a few).
Order them a half-size smaller- 
These are great boots. Old school style. Diego Maradona used to wear them- what more do you need to know? Very comfortable. Excellent touch. Good durability. I've had a few pairs over the years. Still love 'em. You won't be disappointed. I would suggest ordering a half-size smaller than your normal shoe. They seem to run slightly big (similar to Adidas).
