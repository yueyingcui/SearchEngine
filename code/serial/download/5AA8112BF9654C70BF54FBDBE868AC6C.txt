adidas Originals Kids Superstar 2 Core (Toddler/Youth)
My son said that this shoe was very comfortable. He wore them the first day, 8 hours on his feet, and no problems at all. His dad even ordered a pair in his size and loves them as well.

These sneakers are perfect for my two year old. My son has to wear a uniform to school so I needed nice white shoes that would be easy to clean and would not pick up every piece of dirt my son ran through. These are incredibly easy to clean and they are not heavy on his feet. I bought these shoes half a size bigger every time and I recommend them to everyone.
Great shoes, true to size. Using them for a uniform all white PE shoe is perfect!
