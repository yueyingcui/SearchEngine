Nike Nike5 Elastico
Love it. Few of the prior comments I read before buying this shoe was buy it in a half size smaller. Mistakenly I bought a half size larger but fits perfect. So it could go either way on size. This shoe only goes one way, and that's on your feet because these kicks are awesome. Definitely catches eyes.
Most of the reviews I read said these shoes are a half size smaller than posted size. So I ordered half size bigger and they fit great! I wear a 10 1/2s and ordered 11s. They ended up being just bigger but not by much. they don't feel a full 1/2 size bigger. I put true to size because they are pretty close to the size ordered, and this way I have a little room to grow. I love these shoes! Very loud!
These run really small. I ordered a size 7 in the SAMBA and it fits my son with plenty of room, while the 7.5 in this shoe is too small and needs to be exchanged for an 8.5. Other than that, the shoe seems great. My son really likes the look.
The shoe size runs small. About one size too small. Narrow and uncomfortable. I thought perhaps they would expand with some use. They didn't. My toes still hurt.
Two of my children already have and love this shoe. They are very active children and wear them for their indoor soccer season. I would say that they run a little snug, so go up a half size. Maybe a bit narrow too.
I wear a women's size 11 I have a wide foot as well. I had to go half a size up with these. They are also not that comfortable.
