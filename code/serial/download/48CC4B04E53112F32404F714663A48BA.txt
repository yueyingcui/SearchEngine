Ryka Studio Flex Mid
These were HUGE on my feet! I ordered my usual shoe size, and my foot felt like it was swimming. The shoe held my ankle securely due to the high grip, but that was about the only thing that felt secure. This shoe did not feel flexible during movement. I tried floor sprints, and every time the shoe bent it dug into my toes. This is probably a nice shoe for certain exercises, and I'd recommend sizing down. Not the shoe for me.
These shoes are not only comfortable, but very supportive. They accommodate my bunions, supination and double hip replacement...and that's a lot to ask for one pair of shoes! Never any discomfort or foot irritation, especially at bunion sites, even after a 50 minute cardio workout/10 minute balance and core strengthening routine, 3 times/week plus Zumba as often a I can get there! Lightweight and true to size. Highly recommend for classes involving dance routines with a lot of side-to-side motion...not a walking shoe.
I teach studio fitness classes and am always on the lookout for a shoe with arch support, forefoot and heel cushioning, yet without that mid-foot flexion that can cause plantar fascitis. This shoe works well -- two other class participants bought it and like it too. It's stable, cushioned, fits true to size. Only drawback is the midcut ankle -- it works on my left ankle but makes my right ankle a bit tender. Overall, thumbs up for this workout shoe.
This shoe is perfect for aerobics. Its light, has a lot of support and it is very flexible. I would definitely recommend them.
I get a 1/2 size smaller than my normal shoe size.
True to size with a pair of lightweight socks. No need to add 1/2 size extra. Not a lot of ankle support but good enough.
