ASICS Kids Gel-MatflexÂ® GS 3 (Toddler/Youth)
This was my first time buying shoes from this site and it was also my first time buying wrestling shoes. I wasn't sure what size to buy my son because as you all know, shoe sizes are all different from one brand to another. I absolutely loved the printout of the foot and its' accuracy. The shoes arrived on time and in perfect condition. I will be a return customer for next year's wrestling season. Thank you!
My little wrestler loves these shoes. Very lightweight and comfortable with a lot of traction. He went down a half a size in them though. Wears a 4 in street shoes and needed a 3.5 in the Asics Matflex.
I bought these for my 5 year old son who has a size 11 wide foot. He tried on the toddler sizes 11 and 12. His wide foot couldn't even make it into the 11! We kept the size 12 and he says they are comfortable. He does a lot of running in these sneakers during wrestling practice and hasn't complained at all about discomfort.
