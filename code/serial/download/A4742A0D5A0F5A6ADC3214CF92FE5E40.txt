Vivobarefoot Evo II L
I absolutely love these shoes! They are incredibly comfortable and lightweight. I have narrow feet, especially in the heel, and these fit well with no heel slippage. I ordered a 39, which is my usual size, and they are slightly snug in length. I've gotten many compliments on the shoes and a lot of people asking me about them. They do look like "normal" shoes, so they're a good barefoot option if you don't want to draw attention to yourself.
I just received these shoes today, and I have not decided yet whether I want to keep them or not. I was hoping, looking at the picture, that there were not any laces to tie, but they are there. I ordered a size 40, which I almost always wear (sometimes I wear a 39), and they are a bit snug at the big toe. Otherwise, they are cute, extremely lightweight, and very comfortable. There is no arch support, but I would not expect that with shoes that are described as barefoot.
