Allen-Edmonds Eastport
Allen Edmonds Eastport British Tan.
I bought some Allen Edmonds dress shoes a year ago, and loved their craftsmanship, looks, and comfort. Being American made, they are well suited to our generally wider feet. 
I needed a casual shoe to replace my aging Ecco shoes. I naturally looked at what Allen Edmonds had. I owned boat shoes in the past. I remember them as not so comfortable and prone to coming apart. They were Timberland. I was curious how Allen Edmonds would tackle making a boat shoe. 
These Allen Edmonds shoes have an extra eyelet that I thought might lend comfort over the arch, and it does. The finish is durable. The stitching is tough, and well done. The soles have very good grip on wet surfaces. It has quality leather that you feel when you put them on. The leather laces are oiled...Good move.
I read the reviews here before I purchased the shoes. My shoe size is 10E. The reviews say the Eastport runs narrow, so I bought the 10EEE. They fit to a tee. 
Pulling the ties tight around the heel prevents blisters. I took my shoes out of the box, cinched them to my feet, and walked a mile in them without any discomfort at all. 
They are certainly distinct looking. I didn't even consider the Mephisto, a shoe costing twice as much, because they didn't have the same quality or the fine looks.
Eastport - 
I have several other pairs of AE dress shoes and ordered my usual size, a 10. I wear a B-width and this shoe was too narrow. I reordered a half size larger and found it was too narrow also.

Worth the cost - 
Well made and comfortable. However, needed to buy it a size bigger.
