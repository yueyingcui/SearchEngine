Converse Kids Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox (Toddler/Youth)
My daughter has narrow, hard to fit feet, and her usual size fit perfect. One review recommends sizing down, but that was not necessary for us.
Perfect! Just be sure to follow their advice to order Chuck Taylor half size smaller than the regular size.
My daughter usually wears size 2, I ordered 1.5 and it was perfect. She loved it. 
These are great shoes but I felt that they are half a size too big. So I just waited until my daughter fit in to them. Once she did she loved them like crazy so you never know what will happen.
I love these sneaks, my son has been wearing chuck ts since he was 2. They're durable, washable, and classic. I only wish that they came as a slip on in this size. At 4 1/2, my son doesn't want help putting his shoes on, but hasn't mastered shoe tying yet. Otherwise, great shoe for the money!
Great classic shoe that will go with almost everything. The shoe runs big; had to order a size smaller than usual.
A little difficult to figure out which size to get. they ended up being a little big.
Great neutral color -- perfect with denim. Love the half size option. Hard to find with Converse and there is a big jump between the size 2 and 3. This was perfect!
I read a ton of reviews about these sneakers running a size too big. I was still leery about actually going down one full size -- it seemed like too much. I went down 1/2 size, and guess what? They were too big. My advice to you...go down the full size. The shoe is great looking - not much support, but we expected that. My 5 year old son loves them. (FYI - My nine year old daughter also wears a full size lower we also discovered.)
