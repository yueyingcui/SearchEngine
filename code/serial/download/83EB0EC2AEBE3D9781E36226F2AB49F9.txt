PUMA Sneakerina Ellipse Wn's
These shoes are really cute and comfy. Based on the other reviews, I ordered a half size up from what I normally wear because people were saying they fit small. I didn't find this to be the case and will have to exchange them for my normal size after all.
My favorite shoes, comfortable, and stylish. They run true to size, and have some give making them easier for everyone's foot-and especially seniors to find a great fitting, slip on shoe.
I love these. I ordered my true size and they fit perfectly. These are my city sneakers. I wear them with a thin low cut liner.
