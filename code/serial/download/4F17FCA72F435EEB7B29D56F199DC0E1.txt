FootMates Connor (Infant/Toddler)
I also wanted to love this shoe. It is so cute but after 2 different sizes and getting the last one in W it still did not work for my 6 year old son. He could get his foot halfway in the shoe and then it was very tough getting the back part of his foot in the shoe. I knew he would not want to keep using the shoe horn every morning to get the shoe on so they will be returned. He was very disappointed because he really liked the shoe. The shoe is comfortable and light -- once you are able to get your foot in. It just appears the midway of the shoe is not wide enough, even with a wide to accommodate the foot.
