inov-8 Bare-Gripâ„¢ 200
Love these shoes! I expected to use them for more mountain hiking off trail, but they have become my more everyday hiking and trail running shoe. In Colorado the rocky trails are hard on the feet in VFF's, the bare grip is becoming my go to shoe for balance between trail feel and protection. The tread on this shoe makes leaping from rock to rock a bit less sensitive, but the overall feel versus tread for my areas trails is worth it. They feel like a lightweight glove the minute you lace them up, comfortable, lightweight, form fitting. I have a high instep, have had no discomfort in these shoes. If I had any complaint it would be they do not make a small enough size. The smallest option is almost 1 size too big for me, so the toe box has more then enough room, but with a padded running sock I can make do. Because the rest of the shoe fits so well my foot doesn't have any issues shifting around even running a trail down hill.
Inov-8 all seem to fit differently. This pair were slightly narrow, like the Talon, and needed to go a half size to get a comfortable fit. As a minimalist shoe they should allow the foot to spread, thus making the toe box a little wider or more flexible. A little too pointy for my taste as well. This shoe has very little toe spring and no cushioning which is nice.
