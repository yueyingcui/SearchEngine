Nike LunarFly+ 3
Overall these shoes are fine for casual wear. Cushioning is great and they look good. However, if you plan on running in them please note the following: Not a neutral shoe and seem meant for slight over pronators, Heel does not lock in place and they seem to run at least a half size larger than other Nike's (this combination makes them seem very sloppy when running).
The Nike Lunar fly is a great pair of shoes for a neutral runner who is looking for a nice responsive shoe. I wear a formal shoe size 9 and a 10 running shoe in Nike running shoes. The Lunar Fly size 10 is perfect.
