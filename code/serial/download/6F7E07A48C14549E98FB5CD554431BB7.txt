Avia A5018M
The Avia is a good looking and comfortable shoe but found it 2 full sizes smaller than marked.  My husband usually wears a 9 to 9.5 shoe.  My husband had to order an 11.5 to fit properly.  Otherwise, a great shoe.
It has been a while since I've bought Avia shoes, so I've forgotten what good stable shoes Avia makes. I am currently training this winter at an indoor track facility and these shoes were just what I was looking for. They have nice arch support and required no time to break them in. I ran in them the day I got them and they are so comfortable. I like Asics, but honestly, these Avias are just as well made and supportive. I expect them to last long as they feel very sturdy. Avia seems to make really durable shoes based on other reviews. I haven't done so yet, but I'm sure these could be used for some weight training. Avia and Nike have the same fit, so go with whatever size you'd wear in Nike, which is usually a half size larger than your true size. I have high arches, but I think anyone could wear these with no problems.
