Stride Rite Sapphire Lighted (Toddler/Youth)
My three year old loves these shoes. I had originally bought her the light up sleeping beauty stride shoes from their website in her regular size 8Â½W and they were snug and hard to put on. I am stuck at home with a broken leg so I sent my parents to exchange the shoes at the store and they picked these out for her and she loves them. They only had a 9W in stock and they fit well with thick socks or layered socks. They are great shoes for girls with wide feet.
