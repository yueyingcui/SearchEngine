Nike Kids T-Run 3 ALT (Toddler/Youth)
I love that these shoes are velcro. Yes, kids need to learn how to tie, and my daughters know how to and do on occasion, but its very handy on school mornings that they can quickly and easily get these on and out the door. The girls loved the purple/silver color. We haven't had them very long, but so far so good. They look very cute on them also. We did order a size up for growing room and because Nike tends to run small. 
This is a great sneaker for my 8 year old daughter! It's comfortable and she has received many compliments on the style and the color (purple). It does run small so we ordered a half size up.

These sneakers look great and hide dirt really well. I'll be buying the next size up for when my daughter grows out of these.
Love these sneakers. I wanted something without laces, and these sneakers are perfect. They slip on easily and are hassle-free. They are also true to size and very durable.
Runs true to size and looks cute. The elastic laces are a wonderful idea.

Nice kids shoe.  My daughter tried it on and loved it but it fits smaller than I expected so I am exchanging it for a larger size.  
My child loves these shoes.  She is difficult to size at times, but she found these to be her new favorites.
