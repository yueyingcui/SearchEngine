ECCO Golf Golf Street 
I am a size 12-1/2 US (impossible to find) but I have found that European size 46 fits perfectly. The Ecco Golf Street is a comfortable shoe, golf or otherwise! I definitely recommend them. Free shipping a plus, and delivery was very fast.
This is my favorite shoe of all time! I highly recommend it. It's super comfortable, very high quality, and it will make you look like a way cooler person if you wear it. I usually need a size 45 but I found that this shoe fits me better in a 44.
Absolutely great! I wear 'em every day - even for golf! Note: I wear an 11.5 D shoe and ordered size 46. Fits great.
These shoes look great and I believe they are comfortable. However, I need a size 14. Please make larger sizes for us big footed guys, thanks.
