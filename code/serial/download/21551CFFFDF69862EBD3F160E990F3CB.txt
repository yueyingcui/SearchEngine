ASICS Gel-1170â„¢
I bought these to replace older model GT-2120's that I'd run flat. ASICS sizing is very consistent in all the pairs that I've owned, and true to what seems to be my size across most brands, which is a 9.5. The cushioning technology is slightly less advanced than my 2120's, but there are many models that are slightly more expensive than these if you have concerns. I wore these for the first time during a 10-mile race, and they felt fantastic, so unless you have serious feet issues these should serve you well. As far as style goes, they're typical running shoes. Look great in the gym, but I wouldn't wear them to impress anyone.
