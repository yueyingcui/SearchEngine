New Balance Kids KV504 (Infant/Toddler)
These sneakers are great! I bought my son a size 8, and when he grew out of them, I bought size 9.
Great shoe! My daughter has what I like to call bionic feet and these fit very comfortably. True to size and easy to put on and take off. Awesome buy!
These shoes are sturdy and cute.  They seemed to be sized accurately.  I would not purchase them again, due to the front velcro strap being too short.  It doesn't stick very well across the top of my daughter's foot.
These shoes run about a 1/2 a size too small. Also, they are very wide, especially at the opening, and even tightening the velcro doesn't help.

My daughter loves to wear these sneakers both barefoot and with socks (when it's cooler weather).  We've had them for only one month, but they are the go-to pair for running, park play dates, and any sort of climbing activity.  She's 2, wears a size 8 so it's a bit roomier, and finds this shoe particularly comfortable after wearing only Stride Rite sneakers prior to the purchase last month.
