Shimano SH-WM62
I consider these a good purchase. Admittedly I am picky about the way I appear when I cycle and find much gear still oriented towards men. I am a tough woman but still want to look lady-like on the road. These white Shimanos fit the bill, as they coordinate with any of my colorful cycling skorts and jerseys. I have medium width feet and the adjustable straps provide a perfect fit. The Euro size 41 fit my standard 8Â½ US feet perfectly. No pinches, no rubbing. I've used them with both my bicycles and fit fine in my old toe straps and road pedals.
