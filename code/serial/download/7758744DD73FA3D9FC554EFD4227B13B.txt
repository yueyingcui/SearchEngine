Native Shoes Jericho
I bought these as a cuter, comfy alternative to rain boot, and I get tons of compliments. I'm thinking about getting a second pair in yellow. They fit true to size, but since they don't come in half sizes, I'd probably recommend going up if you wear a half size (I'm usually a 9.5, I got the 9, and they fit fine, but make my feet a little sore by the end of the day).
If you are looking for a great lightweight shoe to wear on the docks or just to 'bum' around town, this is the shoe for you. Very comfortable, true to size, and cute as a button. I will buy several more pairs in different styles.
