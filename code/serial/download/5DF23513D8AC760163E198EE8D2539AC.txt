Nike Flex Experience Run
Very true to size, I'm 7 1/2 but a little closer to 8. Light, flexible, comfortable. I've been running and playing sports for seven years, and these are my favorite shoes so far. Would definitely recommend. 
I went with the other reviews I read and got 1 half size larger than I wear. They fit perfect. I wore the sneakers for touring and short walks on the boardwalk. Comfortable and stylish.
The shoes are wonderfully light and look fun with the bright colors. They are comfy but I did notice that my toes go right up to the border at the top and at the side of the little toes. They're made of fabric so they give. Maybe they're supposed to fit this way. I would prefer to exchange them for a half-size larger. I usually fit perfectly in a 10 but not this time. I'll be returning for the first time so cross your fingers!
These are really nice shoes. They are very comfortable, with a little support for underpronation and plenty of cushion. They are lightweight and seem to fit true to size. I still had to return them because I just didn't like the way they looked. With a white sole on a white background in the picture, I couldn't tell how much white there was.
