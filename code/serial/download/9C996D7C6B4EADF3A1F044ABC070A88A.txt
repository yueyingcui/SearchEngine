Sanuk Castaway Sunbrella
I usually get a size 7 in Sanuks but for some reason this style was tighter than the usual Sanuk. It might be because of the lace in the back of the heel. I am going to try to reorder them in 8 because I love them!
Love these! They have a slightly wider fit than the Shorty's so if you have a really narrow foot I suggest going a half size down. Despite the wider feel they do not slip off of my foot while walking. Overall great shoe!
