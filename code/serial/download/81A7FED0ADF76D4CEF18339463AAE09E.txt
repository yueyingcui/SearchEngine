SKECHERS Raptures
I really like these shoes. I had to buy a half size bigger than other shoes but they are just comfy! I even wear them to work with slacks because they can fake being dressy enough.
These shoes are not made like they used to be. I buy these for work as I am on my feet all day. They used to be more comfortable with better padding on the inside, but the latest pair are almost rock hard. The rubber tip at the front of the shoe also splits away after a short time of wearing them, but does not affect the entire sole so they are still wearable when this happens. Not very happy at all with my newest pair. They also seemed like I needed to purchase them a size larger this time.
