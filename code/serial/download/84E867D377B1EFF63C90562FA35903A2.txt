Rieker L7160 Eike 60
I love these shoes! I've been having foot problems and thought I was doomed to wear sneakers for all time, but after wearing these every day for about a month, no more foot pain! They're cute and sporty looking, sorta euro-chic. And best of all, because my pain has gone away, now I can wear my fancy shoes when I have to dress up. I usually wear a 9.5 in flats/low heels and the 41 is perfect. FYI, I have a pair of Rieker snow boots in the same size that are a tiny bit snugger than these are. Not a lot, just means I wear thicker socks with these and thinner socks with the boots.
