Nike Kids Dual Fusion ST 2 (Youth)
Purchased this for my 13 year old daughter who wears a size 6.5-7 in women's shoes. She loves the look and feel of these shoes as they are light and comfortable and accommodates her orthotics. She's been wearing them on a daily basis to school and also to hockey dryland and softball hitting practices. They still look great!
This shoe was a replacement for a different brand that just didn't hold up to my nine year old's running around. The Dual Fusion makes a statement and my daughter really likes it. We did have to order a half size larger than normal.
