Ecco Performance Ultra Terrain Lite - Monterey
I love these shoes. I always like Eccos, and these are no exception. They're super comfortable, the fit is perfect and they have great mid-sole support, which is something I was looking for due to a recent injury. I'm thinking of ordering another pair in a different color. I usually wear a size 41 in European shoes and a 9 1/2 in US sizes. Not sure why the box says that size 41 is equivalent to a size 10-10.5. These shoes are true to size for a Euro size 41/US size 9.5
