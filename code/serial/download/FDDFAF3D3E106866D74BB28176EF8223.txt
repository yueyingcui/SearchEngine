Heelys Straight Up (Toddler/Youth/Adult)
My daughter loves her Heelys! Quick shipping and true to size. Great quality skating shoe.
Great shoe - definitely at least a full size smaller than marked. My 8 year old normally wears a 1 and we had to buy a size 3 to fit.
I wanted Heelys for a long time and my mom finally bought them! They are so cool and I love pink. Tip: get 1 size bigger!
My daughter loves these! She used them all day. They run a little small so get a size bigger!
Just got my Heelys, I really like them! I have not put the wheels in them yet. I wanted to see the sizing on how they fit and felt. Some say they needed a larger size, I usually wear a 10 in womens and that is what I got with my Heelys too. They feel nice on. They are very well made, so I see them being very durable to last years. These black suede ones are a very warm shoe,I am giving them 4 stars on comfort, because if your someone who don't want a extra warm shoe, this might not be the one for you. Wish they had a few vent holes in them. Overall, really like the shoe!
Bought these for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas! They are fabulous...size was right on...easy to wheel around on! Shes absolutely thrilled with them. Would definitely recommend!
This is my daughters second pair of Heely's each time we have ordered a size larger than her regular shoe size and they fit great feel comfy and make dragging her around shopping malls a breeze. Very fun shoes took her a week of practice and now she is a pro.  To walk while wheels are in the shoe you have to do a slight tip-toe step. Wheels are removable with a tool that is included and a plug also included can be put in the empty space.
sent back to change size. runs very small 
Runs small ordered one size up from everyday shoes, toe is at end of shoe must order another size up.
