Nike Lunarfly+ 3 Breathe
These nike shoes are very comfortable, flexible and very lite. Love the color! Great for walking or running. I usually wear a 6 1/2 in most shoes and these were true to size.
I've been running in these shoes for a couple of weeks now and have no complaints. They are lighter weight than my previous running shoes but still cushioned. I ordered a half size larger like I do in all running shoes, and they fit perfectly. I love the light gray and lime color I chose.
I normally can not wear Nike shoes because they are too wide; however, these fit perfectly. I find that Nike does run about a half size small so I need a 10.5 instead of my normal 10. I wore these to walk around Europe with and I got them the day before I left for the trip. I was a little worried I would get blisters from them being new, but they were wonderful! I had zero issues with them!
