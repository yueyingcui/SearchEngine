adidas Mundial Goal
This boot is incredible. Super soft, comfortable leather, great touch, feel and grip. The best indoor shoe I have used out of many, including Joma Top Flex, Puma King, Nike5 Leather Gato, Diadora Maracana which are all good also. Fits my wide foot comfortably. Size-wise, I think this runs about a quarter size long, though not quite a full half-size long. I.e., I normally wear a 9, but an 8.5 in these fits comfortably with a tad less toe room than normal. Insole is removable, although it requires some prying loose. Durability seems very solid too. Overall, an unbeatable shoe.
