Tretorn Otto Canvas
Really wish they had sent me the right size. Ladies take notice: a mens 6 is a womens 7.5 NOT 8! I tried to order a women's 8 and was sent 7.5 both times. Too bad, besides crushing my toes they seemed really comfy.
This is a cool, lightweight, unique boat shoe.  And a great value!  I'm very happy with my purchase.  If you plan to wear without socks, opt for a half size smaller.
Very comfortable shoe, true to size and is a great shoe for around the house. I especially enjoy it while driving long distances, has good grip and you don't think you are even wearing a shoe.
