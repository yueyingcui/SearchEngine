Nike Air Max Challenge
Nike is the only brand I can buy in Men's and they have never failed to disappoint me. I am a womens size 8 and bought this shoe and all my Nike shoes in Mens size 7. I like the extra room in the arch so I can wear inserts or orthotics in the shoe. These shoes are super flashy and will draw a lot of attention meanwhile you will be super supported and comfy. Love all the colors of these shoes not the typical tennis shoe but the bottom is non marking with a sticker right on the bottom if anyone asks. The ventilation on the one side of shoe is a great idea to wick away moisture and the other side is sturdy leather for the outer support. This shoe is very smart in design and function - way to go Nike!
