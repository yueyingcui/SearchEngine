Reef Kids Grom Soulwolf (Infant/Toddler/Youth)
I bought these in a size 2-3 for my son who wears a size 2 and a half to size 3 shoe, and he could not get them on his feet.  They seem to run narrow and small.  The canvas material does not give much and the elastic at the edge of the upper lip doesn't stretch much. I reordered them in a size 4-5 and, although they are a bit long at the toe area, at least he can get them on and he says the are very light weight and comfortable!
