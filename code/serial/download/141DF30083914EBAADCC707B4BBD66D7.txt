Native Shoes Howard
Love these shoes. I ordered them too big the first time and when I reordered them a size smaller, they were a little snug. But after wearing them a couple of times, they fit perfectly and are very comfortable! I can put them in the sink and wash them out if they get dirty and they are great!
These are cute but terribly narrow. I have wide feet so ordered a full size larger than normal and still could barely get my feet in. These aren't mediums, they're narrows. They have good arch support. I like that the soles are nearly flat (the heel is 1/4 in. higher than the toe). I love the idea of foam shoes but haven't found any that I can actually love yet.
I love my Natives. The first time I tried them on, I kept them on. Very comfortable but don't order a size smaller, they are very true to size.

Too small for this size - the sizing on my Corrado shoes was perfect, but this pinched my toes and was uncomfortable. Will try a bigger size.
