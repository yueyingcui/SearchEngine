Converse Kids Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Hi (Toddler/Youth)
My 4-year-old son loves these shoes! They are the fourth pair we have bought for him, and it's the only style of shoe he wants to wear. They fit well and seem to be true to size.
I actually bought these 1 size too big. Usually my child has problems putting high tops on, but the shoe being 1 size up allows ease. I love the look of this shoe and it's what's in (trending) right now. We will more than like buy another pair in a different color and style.
We love these. Have them in every color. True to size and a little wider than the average shoe for added comfort. Very durable as well!
This is a great, classic shoe that goes with everything. Whats even better is that they still look cute even when they are a little worn. They run about a 1/2 size big, my daughter measures a 13 with a foot sizer and the 12.5 fits her perfectly with room to grow. 
I ordered these Converse for my daughter dance performance but she liked them so much she wears them all the time, especially to summer camp because they are all black so they won't look worn out quickly. Also order a size smaller then you normally would because they run big
These are super cool shoes. My son is 8 and he wears them non-stop and they still look great. They do seem to run a full size too big. Great shoe.
