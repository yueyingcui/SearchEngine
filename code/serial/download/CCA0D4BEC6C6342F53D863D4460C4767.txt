adidas Originals adiRise Mid
It's awesome! just keep in mind, that if your feet has wide width than you should go for bigger sizes, other than that, its good!
The shoes were for my 13 year son. They are true to size and look better than in the picture. The strap doesn't go all the way across the front of shoe, but enough to stick. He loves them!
I bought these for my 17 year old nephew. He loves these shoes. He said they look "sharp" and run true to size. He also said none of his friends have them which is an added bonus.

These shoe are very comfortable, moreso than expected, but be careful they were a little narrower than I were expecting. So you may have to go up half size for better comfort, if you do have skinny feet.
