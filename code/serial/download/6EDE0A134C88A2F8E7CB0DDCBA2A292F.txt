Nurse Mates Willow
I love this shoe. But! I ordered the size dress shoe I wear and I couldn't get my foot in to it. Reorder one size longer and wider. Now it fits, but to much pressure on my bunion. My orthotics do not fit. I had high hopes but this shoe just won't work.
I ordered these in my normal size 8 and had to return because they are too small.  I\'m sure an 8 1\/2 would fit great although I did not reorder these.
I expected shoes designed for nurses to be soft, fairly lightweight, and offer excellent arch support. These shoes meet none of those expectations. The arch support is barely there (a little soft cushion where the arch should be), the leather is stiff, and 7.5B -- which is usually a generously sized fit -- was a smidge too tight and too small. In black, the shoes DO look cute when you wear them -- they'd be fine with black work slacks, with jeans, or with tights and a shorter skirt. But, they're really not sized or built for people with foot problems.
