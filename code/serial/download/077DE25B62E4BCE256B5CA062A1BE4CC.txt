Merrell Barefoot Road Glove
Great shoe. Be careful if you have a very narrow foot. I'm normally a 11 and ordered a size 11. They were way to big and had to go to a 10.5. 
This is a very hot shoe as in attractive to others who see it on your foot. My trainer loved it. And I feel it's a winner over and beyond what others might think too.
The shoe fits true to size. Will fit a wide foot as in 2E fine. And of course it's just simply very "cool" to have a barefoot shoe in your closet and on your foot. Especially if you want a date!
