Vans Kids Big School (Infant/Toddler)
These shoes are just too cute and they fit good. Get one half size smaller than you wear. So cute they are.
Was much larger than I expected. I bought four other brands in size 9, and this was at least 1/2 inch longer.
Totally worth it!
I love this shoe. It's priced well and totally comes in totally cool patterns/colors. Hardly any break-in necessary. Always a full size bigger than marked.

These shoes rock!
I LOVE these shoes! I wish they had more styles available in my daughter's size because I would be buying them.
It took a bit for my 12 month old to get used to walking in them but they aren't nearly as clunky as some sneakers and she's doing great in them. The velcro style is great for toddlers and the fit is true to size. My daughter has narrow feet but these fit well.
Again...I'd be buying more right this minute if there were more styles in her size.

The shoes are very cute, but I do not think the sizes are true to fit. I had to return them and get a smaller size. I have one daughter with narrow feet and one with thick feet and the shoes are not very comfortable for the thick foot.
