These shoes are even cuter in person. I got the green ones and it is a perfect shade, true to what is in the picture. I wear an 8 to 9 depending on the shoe and the brand, with my true size being an 8½ and an 8½ fit perfectly. My heel is narrow and my forefoot wider and I did not have any trouble with my heel slipping or my toes being squished. The suede is super soft and seems like it will stretch quickly, so that is something to consider when sizing, if you are in between. There is an arch support insert on the insole, which I promptly deconstructed because I do not like anything poking at my arch, but those of you who like arch support will be pleasantly surprised, especially for such a flat shoe. I would actually like to remove the insole completely but the construction is bare bones and messy under the insole. I might actually find a thinner insole though, because I like a barefoot feel. The shoe is very comfortable and a nice twist on an oxford. I gave it four stars overall because of the messy construction inside, though it has not made the shoe uncomfortable, it is still not a super cheap shoe so I would expect a little more tidiness inside. But overall, I feel like I found a real treasure that I will wear for a long time.
