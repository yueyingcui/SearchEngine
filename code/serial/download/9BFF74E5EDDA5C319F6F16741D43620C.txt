Shimano SH-MT23
My requirements for this shoe were a stiff sole for better control while biking, but enough flexibility in the toe so that it could be walked around in. In that regard, the shoe performs very well. The footbed is supported well, and the shoe is very comfortable to wear while biking, and comfortable enough to walk in for a distance. Be very careful when ordering these shoes, since the "US Men's Size" doesn't actually refer to a men's shoe size, but the measure of the footbed. I suspect that this is the same in women's sizes. Check the shoe size charts to convert UK sizes to US sizes, and you should be fine.
These are my first cycling shoes. I liked the lace-up style for better control of fit and because they look more like normal shoes for off-bike wear along my rides. The sizing threw me, because I wear a 10.5/11 sneaker and 43/44 size Eccos (depending on style), yet the EUR size equivalent for 10.5/11 in this shoe was listed as 45. When they arrived, the shoe fit quite roomy and the heel slipped a bit when I walked. However, as a newbie to clipless cycling, it wasn't until after I rode with these shoes that I appreciated the huge difference in fitting a cycling shoe from other shoes; the heel slipping I noticed when I walked is moot when pedaling, and these shoes feel great for their intended use. My best advice to new cyclists is to keep in mind when fitting that they aren't meant to fit like typical shoes. There's zero arch support (which doesn't affect me because I have custom insoles).
Unlike the other Shimano styles I tried, this one was true to size. This shoe is light, appears well made, and is comfortable. It may be a little too lightweight for rugged terrain. It is surprisingly easy to walk in. I went on my first ride in them yesterday (20 mi.) and absolutely loved them. Far superior to the much more expensive shoes I also tried (some of them Shimano) IMHO.
