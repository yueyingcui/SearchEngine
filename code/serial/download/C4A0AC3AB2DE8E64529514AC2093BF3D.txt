New Balance WR890
Great shoe. Love them. Really comfortable, lots of toe room. True to size.
I love these shoes! My foot is a little on the wider side and these shoes fit perfectly from the start. No break-in period at all. I have worn them daily for a few weeks now and they still look brand new. People love the pink and gray colors and so do I! I typically wear a half size smaller but I like my running shoes to have a little extra space so I ordered a half size up.
