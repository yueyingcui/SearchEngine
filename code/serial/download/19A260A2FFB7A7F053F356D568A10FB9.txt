Vans Rowley (SPV)
These are comfortable casual shoes with great style. Although they don't have that much support or padding, they hold up well to a day of walking (or skating, I imagine). It took me a while to find the right size: I ended up fitting an 11.5 when I'm normally a 10.5-11. I would also say that they run a bit narrow.
