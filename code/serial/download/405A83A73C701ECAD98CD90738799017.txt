Sperry Top-Sider A/O Salt Stained
Interesting that someone purchased down a size. I bought 12s because my other Sperry shoes are 12s and fit perfectly. This shoe is incredibly tight at 12s. I'm going to have to return and order my regular size of 13. Maybe the shoes were marked wrong at the factory??? They really feel like 11s.
Bought these for my husband and he loves them. He says they are very comfortable. We ordered down a size than he normally wears based on reviews in the grey color. It is more of a light tannish grey...very versatile color and casual to wear with shorts or jeans.
