ECCO Spin Lace Up
Where is your Quality Control? The left shoe in this pair was a much lighter shade than the right shoe, was a size bigger (though still marked as the same size, and the footbed insert was a smaller size than the shoe. This the is quality you would find in the seconds bin at an outlet store not at this price. I have reordered and the next pair was fine. Could have done without the hassle.
