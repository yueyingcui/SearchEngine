Fossil Bruno Boat
All the materials are very flexible so the shoes fit well to your feet.  Under the insole there is a piece that is a cardboard material which starts to rip where it is stitched in after a while. Fits true to size.  Very good boat shoe overall. 
Despite other reviewers' comments, these shoes are well built and fits more true to size than Sperry Top-Siders. My only complaint is that I had to pull out the insole and glue it back in so it would not stick to my foot when I take them off. These are highly recommended.
