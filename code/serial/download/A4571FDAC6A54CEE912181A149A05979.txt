Superga 2790 ACOTW Linea Up and Down
I have worn these shoes so much that the fabric inside is starting to rip but I honestly do not care. I love these shoes to death. I got the white to lighten up my summer wardrobe; they were definitely my go to sneakers. I have the regular Supergas but I had to order them half a size smaller than my normal shoe size (size 9), but for the platform ones, I had to go a full size smaller than my normal shoe size. I definitely love the sneakers; I do feel like they make a casual outfit a bit fancier with the platform. Do not hesitate to buy these shoes; they are sincerely amazing shoes.
These are the cutest sneakers ever!  I love the platform!  These are not true to size though and they seem to run a full size smaller than your normal size. I do love these though and own a few pairs.
I ordered these shoes as soon as I saw them. They're adorable and well priced. But when I received my size 6, I was surprised by how huge it was. I am a true 6 and these shoes were literally flopping off of my feet. Not wearable at all. I decided to order the next size down - a 35. They're still large and have the same flopping problem. Because the sole does not bend as you walk, these are total sock eaters. They pull your socks down and into the shoe and pull off of your heel. I'm still trying to figure out if I can stuff the back heel with moleskin to make them work...or if I should be more practical and just return them. Disappointing as they're so cute.
