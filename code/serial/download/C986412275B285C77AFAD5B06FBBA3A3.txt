PUMA Fast Cat Lea Wn's
Very cute with jeans and shorts.  I wanted a pair of sneakers that didn't look bulky. I save my bulky sneakers for exercise. The Pumas are for style. I ordered 1/2 size larger than I wear, though. 
Its a really cute shoe, but when I tried it on, it was an immediate return. Unfortunately, these shoes run really small and tight. I never considered my feet to be wide or anything, they are pretty average, and I get the regular size and same size for every brand and it always works out. But, like I said, these shoes run small and tight, I wear a 7.5, and would probably have to wear an 8 or 8.5. Will not be exchanging, just returning.
