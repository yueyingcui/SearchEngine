Nike Tiempo Mystic IV IC
These are great shoes, but the sizes run small. I bought it for my boyfriend, who normally wears an eleven and a half, and in these shoes he had to get a thirteen. But he loves em...
These shoes were the wrong size. I have other pairs of size 9 sneakers and these were size 8-8.5 Disappointed. Returning them and exchanging for size 9.5.
Great shoe for touch but the sizing is way off. They do stretch quite a bit after actually playing a game in them, but not enough to buy them true to size. If you liked the old Ronaldinho shoes this is about as close as it gets, but I wish Nike would bring their old sizing back.
