Josef Seibel Felicia Lace Up
Cute look, lightweight, but disappointing fit and support. Happened to have a Seibel shoe from a few years back on the other foot while trying this on. The roomier toe box and good support of my old Seibels were definitely lacking in this one, with a tight toe area even though I ordered a size up from my usual. Unfortunately, this one's going back.
Beautiful shoe and extremely comfortable!  Very unique style.  Shoe was true to size.  
This comfortable shoe does run a size small. I am a true 40 and needed the 41. They are perfect now!
