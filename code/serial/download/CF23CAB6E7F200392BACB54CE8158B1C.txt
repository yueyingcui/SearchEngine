adidas Kids SambaÂ® Millennium Core (Infant/Toddler)
These Sambas fit my 2 year old perfectly.  They are true to size and the removable insole helps to ensure a perfect fit.  I would recommend these as well as any of the the other Sambas.  However, these Sambas are a bit wider than the usual slim-cut Sambas.  
Absolutely love these shoes. I only let my son wear them on the weekend so they would last, but as his foot began to grow and they were still looking good I allowed him to wear them to preschool. I figured they would be ruined in a couple weeks from him playing in the sand and running around. However they look as good as the day I bought them. I only wished they went higher in size as he is almost out of the size 10's I purchased.
My almost 3-year-old son loves his new soccer shoes! I think they are great, except for one problem - the tongue always slides under the laces no matter how tightly we lace them. This makes for lots of re-tying episodes. This may only be a problem for the smaller sizes. I'd still get them again though!
