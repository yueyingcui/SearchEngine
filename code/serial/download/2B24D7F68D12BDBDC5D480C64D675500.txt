Vans SK8-Hiâ„¢ Core Classics
If your child has a wide foot and finds sneakers uncomfortable, this just might be for him.  My son really likes his pair (and we tried a lot of different sneakers).  We ordered one size up and they fit great.  We are very happy with these sneakers and will definitely order Vans again.
I looked back in my account history to see when I bought these shoes. You have to be kidding me, it was less than two months ago. I bought these shoes because they looked super slick and I like Vans (except that they're made overseas, but I thought I'd give them one last chance). Dude. I don't even skate. I wear these shoes at all times, and I think they might have been a size too small, but that doesn't excuse what happened. Within two months the soles have worn through, and the shoes fit weird because of some kind of sinkage in the rubber. I'm a big guy, I ordered 12's, but I think that this is ridiculous. I'm never buying Vans again.
I love the look of these shoes, and they have great ankle support for those of us with injured ankles. The insole is the weak point, they have no padding or support. I ripped the glued insoles out and replaced them with sorbothane insoles and they are worlds better. They are inexpensive and the quality somewhat reflects this but still a good deal for the money. They run a full size or more too small.
The shoe top is lower and the shoe is wider than it looks in the photo. They fit a half size up. Quite comfortable. Overall they are nice shoes and quite stylish.
