Keds Kids Champion Lace Toe Cap 2 (Infant/Toddler)
These are great shoes that seem to run true to size. The leather is quite durable and the rubber toe cap is holding up well to my toddler's play. They clean up easily, too, which is one of the reasons I bought them in the leather as oposed to the canvas. We went through three pairs of the canvas in stone color since he was 1 year old. He's about to turn two now. So, I think the canvas ones lasted about 3 mos each with almost daily use. Thse so far still look new and he's had them about a month. What I really like about them is that they go well with casual clothes like shorts and a t-shirt, while also looking sharp with more dressy outfits like button down and khaki pants or shorts. Also, I find these to be a classic choice over the more popular but often cheap looking character shoes available for toddlers. As far as comfort, no blisters and seem to fit perfect. My son has the normal chubby toddler feet, not wide, but not narrow. Also, the shipping is fast.
Great shoe! Not only looks good, has nice support and is true to size.
Always a great classic shoe. It fits very true to size and cleans up well in regular wash cycle!
I bought these shoes for my daughter as summer shoes. They are so cute. They look great with pants and summer dresses. The only thing is that I had to get her size in a wide because Keds tend to run narrow. Also, love that they are leather and wipeable. Weâ€™ve gotten lots of compliments on these shoes.
Great little sneakers that, in the narrow size, fit my daughter's narrow little feet perfectly. This is our third pair in a row---we just keep ordering the next half-size up as she grows.
