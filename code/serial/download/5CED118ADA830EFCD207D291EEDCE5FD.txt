New Balance W780
I ordered the same size as my last pair of NB = 6 and when I got these they were short and tight. I reordered the 6.5 and they fit great. Like the light feel too but can run on gravel without rolling over, and the pavement.
Tongue was not wide enough to cover my entire foot, even in the wide size. It seems that NB forgot to compensate the tongue's width for the wide size.
