Teva Riva eVent®
The Teva Riva eVent is a great shoe. Order half a size larger though. I wear a solid size 9 in everything else, but the 9½ fits perfectly. I liked them so much that I bought the mesh version also.
I purchased these shoes for a week long trip to London and Paris back in the spring and ended up ordering these a half size larger to allow for thicker socks. They held up quite well and were very comfortable despite walking for hours at a time. They also kept my feet warm and dry in the notoriously fickle UK weather. Highly recommended for urban trekking and some light hiking.
Great shoe for cold weather. It is very waterproof and worked for me quite well traveling throughout India in February. You can walk comfortably forever in this shoe. It feels very snug in the beginning but will break in well after about ten to twenty miles in them. Fits well for my wide feet. Looks very nice! Previously I tried the Garmont Nuvi Vegan and it was too tight on the width even with a size up.
