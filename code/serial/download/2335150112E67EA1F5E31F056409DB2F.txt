Nike Lunar Montreal
Super light (lighter than my flip flips) and very nice feel. I did have to re-order a 1/2 size larger.
Typically I am a size 9 1/2 - in Nike sneakers / golf shoes a 10. These ran at least a 1/2 size smaller. I should have ordered a 10 1/2 - but I'm not good at returning so I've kept the 10's.
