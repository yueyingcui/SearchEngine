Vans Classic Slip-Onâ„¢ Core Classics
Backs are a little stiff if you wear with no socks. I have wide feet and they fit great and true to size.
Great all everyday shoes that look good with almost anything. You're not going to find better quality for under my budget than this. Despite people claiming these to be true to size, they're not. I have 3 other pairs of Vans, all size 10, and these are bigger. I have to order a 9.5 instead of 10, to get the fit of a 10. All my other pairs of shoes are also size 10: Puma's, Nikes, New Balance...if you always get the same size shoe, get a half size smaller on these, otherwise your foot will be sliding back and forth, and side to side. Highly recommended!
I have a 15 year old with size 15 feet! He loves the comfort of these shoes, plus they do have the support he needs for a casual shoe. He only knows he likes the fit and style!
I love the black and white checkered ones. I thought I'd get a pair for myself and they ended up a little too big. I should of bought a size down but it's okay. I'll save these shoes for my boyfriends little brother.
Great shoes, true to size! I've been wearing Vans for years, so just keeping buying the same size over and over again, but it's the same size I wear in most other shoes.
My first pair of Vans ever were the Era Laceless and I loved them for everyday/casual wear. I then decided try the Classic Slip-On Core Classic and they are now my new favorite shoes. They are comfortable out of the box. They looks great with jeans or shorts. I love them! Oh and since I already had the Era Laceless that I bought from the Vans retail store I already knew my size.
Great shoe, I wear size 15 so it's hard to find variety at the Van's store. So this website is my best friend.
Nice slip on shoes with (now) classic style.  Reasonably comfortable and a good choice for summer shoes.  Quality is better than most; durable.  The sizing is a tad on the small size.
