PUMA Complete TFX Distance 3
I just returned the shoes and ordered a full size larger. One of the other reviews said they run large; my experience is quite the opposite. I should've gone with my past experience with Pumas and ordered a full size larger the first time. Looking forward to getting the larger pair.
