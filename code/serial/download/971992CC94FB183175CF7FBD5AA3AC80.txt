Nike Kids Free Run 3 (PSV) (Toddler/Youth)
My daughter's new favorite shoes. She finds them very comfortable and loves the girly touches, like glittery laces. I love the practicality and how flexible they are. I do wish there was a way to tighten them a bit more -- she is in between sizes and we intentionally bought these a tiny bit big, sometimes they will slip off her feet.
Great color and style, easy for my 5 year old to put on herself and remove.  Always gets compliments.  Comfortable for running, tennis and even has worn worn them hiking.  
The only negative comment is she has a small frame and thin legs and shoes appear heavy and thick for her size.
