New Balance Kids KV633 (Toddler/Youth)
My 9-year old daughter had these last year, and wore them almost every day so they are now really worn out. She loved the slip on style, and usually wears a wide shoe, so this is the only style we found that comes in both. Unfortunately, this version has been updated to include a satiny lining inside the heel, so her heel slips out with every step. I've tried ordering in varying widths and sized up and down to try to get it right, but the problem persists. Sorry to have to send them back.
Great easy on fit. So nice to find a cute shoe in size wide. My daughter has high arches that require a Wide fit, and she says these are very comfortable. So far have been very durable for school and traveling.
