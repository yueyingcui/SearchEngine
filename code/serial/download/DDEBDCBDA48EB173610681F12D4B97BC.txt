New Balance MX1211
I've been pleased with this shoe.  As someone who is flat footed and always needs a shoe that helps to prevent overpronation, this shoe helps with its firm medial post.  One thing to keep in mind is that the toe area closest to the big toe is angled inward and touches the top front of the big toe (the spot that is prone to become ingrown if your shoes are too tight) more than average.  Also, the shoe runs a perfect size.  I usually am forced by other shoe brands to wear a size 12 because no 11.5 is available.  This shoe in 11.5 fits perfectly.  Lastly, the insole the shoe comes with is quite thin and provides almost no arch support if you have flat feet like I do.  I pulled the insole out and inserted a Men's size F Superfeet insole (no trimming required) and the shoes are now awesome by way of support.
