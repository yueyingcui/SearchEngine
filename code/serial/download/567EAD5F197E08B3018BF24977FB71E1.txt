Salomon Techamphibian 3
This is a great summer everyday shoe tor me. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 overall and in comfort is the Techamphibian 3 doesn't come in a narrow size. I am glad, though, of the adjustable strap at the heel which makes the fit better. I have two pairs and really enjoy wearing both colors. The sand color goes with everything I wear.
I had these a few years ago and thought it was time for a new pair. I'm always a size 9, not ever in-between, and the 9 in these felt a little big - maybe just a half size. Other than that, they are great - very comfortable, very cute.
This water shoe is "almost perfect" but the non-elastic, nylon drawstring is a deal-breaker for me...it feels like a high-maintenance, breakable, very thin shoelace. I'm a Keen girl from way back and will always favor the no-hassle elastic cord. I haven't lost faith in Salomon over this though and this is an excellent shoe otherwise. Be sure to buy at least a 1/2 size down from your regular size.
