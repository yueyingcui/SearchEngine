New Balance W587
Read all the reviews and decided to go for these. I have a bunion the size of Delaware on my right foot so I worried. I can generally wear 7.5 but ordered 8 which leaves room for heavier socks and was not sorry. Took only one wearing for them to be super comfortable. Now they are my new best shoes.
