ASICS Gel-260â„¢ TR W
They are breathable, lightweight, stylish, and perfect running shoes. True to size. The best running shoes I have ever had.
True to size, very comfortable, no break in period. Colors (green) bright & pretty. I always wore Nike before but now this is my new favorite brand of athletic shoe!
I thought they would be a bit flimsy and not supportive of my foot, but I was pleasantly surprised.  They hold my inserts perfectly and fit true to size.
I spent quite some time researching which pair of Asics to buy. I needed an indoors-only pair for the gym and studio classes. These are stylish and were comfortable when I wore them to my BodyWorks class today. I am a true size 6 with a normal arch and normal width. All of my Asics over the years have fit true-to-size and I would not recommend ordering a larger size like some of the other reviews have suggested, unless you like your athletic shoes to have an inch or so extra in the toe.
I love Asics brand shoes - I have worn them for years. I'm an avid walker and the brand holds up well. This particular shoe - Gel-260 TR W - is extremely comfortable and I found true to fit. I ordered a 6.5 (my normal walking shoe size) and it fit perfectly. Supports/cushions my problem area (around my big toe) well.
I have worn the Asics running shoes for years and love them. I am doing P90X now, and I decided to try these cross trainers in the same size and they are a perfect fit. They offers decent lateral stability which is essential. I wear a neoprene brace on my left ankle (I am recovering from an ankle fracture), and while the shoes are snug they conform well to my feet. Like most Asics athletic shoes, the mesh upper tends to stretch out over time and the shoes becomes looser and less stable. But hopefully I will get several months out of this pair before that becomes an issue. And I love the black/purple color! It is so cute!
