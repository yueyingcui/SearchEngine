Nike Air Serve Return
Nice shoes for tennis but they are still a little tight but I'm sure they will loosen up after I wear them more. I did have to order a 1/2 size up. 
I personally like a harder sole, and these are cushioned, but not as much as your average Nike (which I generally find too soft - especially in running shoes). I tried on a number of tennis shoes and while I usually wear a 6, when it comes to the Nike brand, I generally wear a 6.5 because I find that they run small. For a tennis shoe, which should fit more snug than a running shoe, this was a true 6 for me - so I think that this particular shoe in Nike is more true to size. This shoe is for a narrower foot, so if you have a wider shoe, I might order up half a size or go with another shoe. One other unique thing about this shoe is that it's not easy to find a colorful tennis shoe that still has a white sole, so this shoe delivers in that department.
These Nike tennis shoes did not fit my foot across the metatarsal arch - too narrow.  Going up a size did not help - the proportions are just not right for my foot, even though other Nike tennis shoes (the City Court and the Zoom Breathe) are just fine.  The styling is cute, but this shoe was not for me.
