Sperry Top-Sider Largo Slip On
Bought these for my husband. He loves them, a great casual summer shoe. He says they run true to size. Hard to go wrong with a boat shoe from Sperry.
Very comfortable and true to size, and require almost no break-in.  Love these shoes.  They are my new go-to summer shoe.
These shoes are great casual summertime shorts shoes, very comfortable, true to size and they have a great look.
