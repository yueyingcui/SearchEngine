Vans Prison Issue #23
They are indeed bulkier when you receive them, but after all, they are skater shoes. I have no problem getting the straps over all the way. Very nice shoes but you will need a couple days of breaking them in. Also I would recommend you buy these shoes a half size larger than your normal size. I was excited when people said they received their shoes in a couple days with the free shipping option, I too chose the same option but didn't receive mine until the full week. Well, it was free so I can't complain! Overall great service.
Cute shoes, more girly and childish than the name would suggest. Thin canvas, so a little flimsier than I thought. Order a half size up!
