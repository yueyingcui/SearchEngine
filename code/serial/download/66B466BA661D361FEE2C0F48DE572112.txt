Nike Action Ruckus Mid LR
Initial impression was that it was not a really great shoe. Something about it strikes me as just average and not that great. The support is super squishy but really has a strong arch, it felt too far forward. The weight was a bit heavy for my taste. I think the shoe is actually a bit smaller than listed size. I tried these and the Nike Mavrk Low and I definitely prefer the Mavrk.
