PUMA Kabo Runner
I got these shoes for Parkour and freerunning and I like them a lot. My sport tears up shoes like no other, and these Puma's are holding up well. The sole is all one piece which is a big plus, because it won't fall apart easily. The shoe is light and flexible. What was surprising is that it for its lack of cushioning, it actually seems to provide very good shock absorption. They feel narrow, so if you have a wide foot do not buy these. Also, they felt a half size smaller than other Puma's I've worn. But that might just be me...I'm very picky about sizing, it has to be perfect. In summary, I would totally recommend these shoes for casual wear, recreational sporting, and of course, Parkour.
I was so frustrated when I got the shoes. Actually I ordered size 8, but I got size 9½. (Yes, size 8 was written on the box) Other issues such as style was not bad. Anyway, I decided to return these shoes.
These are really stylish shoes, and they should be comfortable to wear if they are a little bit bigger. I usually wear men's 10½, Kabo 10½ is pretty narrow at the toe. Also they feel a little bit smaller on overall length. I have reordered a men's 11 size. I will give feedback on that later.
