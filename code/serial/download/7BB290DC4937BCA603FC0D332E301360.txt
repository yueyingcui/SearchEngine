Nike Lunar Allways+ TR
Been searching for a shoe to do my Insanity workouts. Proving to be more difficult than I would have imagined. I would recommend going up a half size in these - my toes were a little crammed, and in jumping movements would often hit the front of the shoe. My toes also felt cramped vertically in the toe box - the top of the mesh was resting on my toes, and I really didn't like that feeling at all. Not sure if this would be improved in a larger size, or if that's just the design of the shoe. The cushioning was great in these - love the feel of the lunar insole. But they didn't offer enough support for lateral movements. These are going back.
I received the item with good qauality. But the color I selected was Yellow but I received is light green. And the shoes size 8 is smaller then the regular size 8 that I usually ware.
I love these shoes. I bought them for Zumba. I have plantar fasciitis and can not tell you how much money I have spent on shoes, the only thing that had worked for me were Mizuno's volleball shoes until I decided to try these out. They are super comfortable and have great arch support. I will say I wish they had a little more lateral support. I am planning on getting another pair in different color. They felt true to size and width. It's so comforting to do my favorite thing (Zumba) without feet pain. I highly recommend them!
