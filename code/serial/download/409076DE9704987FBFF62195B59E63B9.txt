New Balance WW956
I had an old pair of NB trekkers and wore them out, so to upgrade, I wanted to get another pair similar to them, but to wear in the rain and light snow. I had thought that these new shoes would be somehow heavier in weight (which I did not want) but happily, they are not. As recommended by other kind reviewers, I did order my true size, a 9, and then also ordered the half size up, and found that what they advised is true, and I needed the larger size. They look just like the picture. Ladies, it's up to you to determine if they are pretty enough, or not. For me, I will take less attractiveness, for function, and that's exactly what I got. Well worth the money.
These are a bit tricky with fit. The last is narrow heal, high instep. I needed a 9.5 instead of my usual 8, but when I figured it out, I'm in walking shoe heaven. My problem feet are a challenge and these shoes are waterproof, warm and accommodate my custom orthotics. Love them. They provide great support. Probably the best short boot/walking shoe I've ever worn. I have a narrow foot, but still required a larger size. Part of that may be my orthotic. Be patient and try different sizes or order 2 sizes and be prepared to return. It's worth it.
These shoes are accurately sized, but the heel slips. I have narrow heels, totally flat arches, and a somewhat wide forefoot.  The heel is too high and bites my ankle with each step. The shoe is stiff, but well made. Unfortunately, the arch support is not in the right position for my feet and the stiff sole dislocates my big toes, so I am sending them back.
