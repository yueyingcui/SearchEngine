Nike Air Relentless 2
Shoe feels comfortable and light, however it was definitely a half size too short.
This pair of shoes is a little shorter than the last pair of Nike running shoes I bought in the same size. Nice light pair of shoes though. Laces seem to be fraying quickly and may break earlier than would typically be expected.
I bought these for my son who is 12. He's a size 8 and they fit him great. He says they are comfortable and I like that they are light and airy for less stinky feet! They are are a good Spring/summer shoe.
I love these shoes, but had to go up a size from my normal running shoe size.  I usually wear an 8 in normal shoes, like heels, a 9 in running shoes and I needed a 9.5 in these.  The price is right and they look great!  Super comfy too!
I just got my new sneakers today and I'm in love! The color is just as bright in person as it looks online. They are very comfortable and light. I think the reason why people say they run small is because they run narrow. I got my normal shoe size, 8.5 and could've gotten away with a 9. But I am still happy with the 8.5. I'm sure they will stretch out after a couple uses. I would definitely recommend these great sneakers to everyone!
I have always worn a 10.5 in a running shoe but these ran at least one size too small. My toe hit the front of the shoe. Love the looks of them!
I love these shoes. They run half size too small, but other then that they are the most comfortable fit. I am usually extremely hard to fit and these were so comfortable that I ordered two more pairs. I love the colors.
These shoes are light and comfortable. The pink is very fluorescent - more than you can tell from the picture. I needed to put orthotics in my shoes - so I would recommend getting a half size bigger. But otherwise I am very happy with these shoes!
