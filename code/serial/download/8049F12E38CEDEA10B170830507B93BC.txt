Saucony ProGridâ„¢ Stabil CS 2
They have really helped my over pronation. If I could gripe about anything, their sizes run just a tad larger than what I am used to, but not too bad. I would buy these again.
Shoe runs a little small, so I ordered a half size bigger. But it is the best one I've tried in quite a while. Very comfortable and great to have it in a wide width for bunion.
