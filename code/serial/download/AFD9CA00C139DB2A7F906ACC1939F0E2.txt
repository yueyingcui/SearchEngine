Vans Kids Old Skool V (Toddler/Youth)
These shoes are definitely good looking but were way too big, even when I returned them for half a size smaller. They rubbed his little heal raw in back because of the ill fit. Even though they are cute I probably wouldn't get them again. He likes them though.
These shoes look great but they are not comfortable. The heel rise in back is so high it digs in to the Achilles and causes pain. My son would not wear them for more than two minutes. I had to send send them back. He is 8 and wears a 3Â½. These shoes actually fit on my feet and I am a Woman's size 7. He is right they did hurt! Back to Converse Chucks. They are the best shoe on Earth.
Great shoe! My son loves it! We are a Vans family and all wear them. Love this style and colors and design are cool. Can wear this shoe dressy or rough and tough! Runs at least a 1/2 size big.
I bought these for my 6 year old nephew. He is not quite ready for laces so these were the perfect, cool alternative. They seemed to fit pretty true to size, maybe a slight bit of room for him to grow into them. He's a size 13 and I got him the 13.5 and they were great. They seem really good quality too, which is nice because he'll be wearing them a lot.
