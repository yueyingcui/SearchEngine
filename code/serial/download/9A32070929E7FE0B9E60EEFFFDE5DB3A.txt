adidas Outdoor AX 1 TR
I ordered these for some day hiking in the mountains in Southern California - boots would have been overkill - and I wanted a little more support than a trail runner. When I ordered these there weren't any reviews yet so I was a little nervous - and I am now regretting the order (and returning it - not sure yet the shoe I will be exchanging for). Overall the style of the shoe is super-cute for a hiking shoe - but the fit I was not impressed with. They ran about a 1/2 size too small and I found my toes hitting the hard toe guard mid-stride...it wasn't bothering me walking around my house, but I knew 5 miles into a hike I would be regretting it. Besides it running a little small - I wasn't too happy with the overall comfort. They really felt stiff - and the soles felt hard under my feet. I'm not sure if this could improve after a break-in period, but I didn't want to risk it.
