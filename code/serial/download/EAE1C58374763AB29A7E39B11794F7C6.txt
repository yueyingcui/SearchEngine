Nike Golf Air Academy II
I haven't played a round in them yet, but I have been wearing the in work for the past 12 hours to break them in and they are very comfortable. Read the review saying to order a size larger and I absolutely agree. I ordered the wide width and they are true to width, but they get narrow towards the toes. Had I ordered them in my usual 10.5 size, they would most likely not had fit comfortably. Provided they last a few years, I will be happy with the purchase.
I liked the style of the shoe but it was definitely small.  I would suggest getting one size larger.  I would have ordered a larger size but had also ordered another Nike that fit fine.
