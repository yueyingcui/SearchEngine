Vans Authenticâ„¢ Slim
These are super-comfortable and fit true to size (I am a size 10 women's, narrow feet). There is more toe room than Keds' version of these, so those with bigger toes will appreciate. I wore them right out of the box. They're a little stiff and slightly cut into the backs of my ankles, but I think that will go away with a few wears. I feel like I could wear them for hours walking around. They also look fantastic; I switched out the black laces for some silver ones to add more pizazz. My only complaint is - just like my other canvas shoes like Vans and Keds - they make your feet sorta sweaty after you've been wearing them for a while. Not much breath-ability. I definitely always wear them with socks, never bare feet.
I love these shoes. I get a ton of compliments and like they are more girly with the slim fit. Sizing is Van's specific so if you have not bought Van's before get a couple of sizes to determine the right one for you. I go down a 1/2 size.
