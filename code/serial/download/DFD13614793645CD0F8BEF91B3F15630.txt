Nike Air Alvord 10
Will say the same as everyone else...go bigger. I normally wear an 8 and am borderline a wide foot. I tried 8 1/2 and my toes were still jammed at the top of the shoe and shoe was too snug. Went with a 9 and it fit perfectly. I've never worn a nine in my life. I love the shoe and it is very comfortable once you get the right size. Grey color is lighter than picture.
Definitely order a size larger. I wear a 9.5 and the 10s were a little snug. They run on the narrow side which is great for me!!! I tried other brands and keep coming back to Nike since it is hard for me to find a comfortable, lightweight sneaker that fits my narrow-ish foot (and I also have flat feet). Love love the colors!!! I did add an insert for a little more support since I need it.
Make sure to order a full size larger I wound up sending back the first pair since I only ordered half a size larger. They are very cute in the pink and grey. They provide great support in heel since I stand all day these are great shoes. You do not get cramps in the legs like you do in a lot of shoes when you are standing all day.
I really wanted to like these shoes because of the darker color (some running shoes make me feel like a human neon sign) and the purple accents, but my usual 8D did not fit well at all. My toes were shoved right up against the toe of the shoe, and they were barely wide enough. I considered trying the 8Â½ instead, but in the end I went with the Saucony Grid Cohesion 5, which fits me perfectly in my regular size of 8W.
I like the color and they are true to size. Light for running. Glad I bought them.
They are true to size and width.  I got them for the gym to be used with a heel orthotic, they are comfortable.  The lime green is more of a yellow neon though.
