Keds Spirit
The W-Wide is not at all a Wide size, very disappointed, returning item.
Very comfy shoe. Like the non-canvas. Could use a bit more arch support. Felt great from the start. Shoelaces are just right, not too long nor too short. I would buy these again. Bought size 11W.
I bought these for my daily walks at work. They run true to size and width. Several have inquired about these.
I purchased this to wear when golfing.  First time out they were very comfortable.  Good color and nice look.  I also purchased the same shoe in white.  Despite being the same size the white ones were painfully too small.  I like this shoe and am sad the white ones didn't fit.
This is my 3rd pair of Spirit Keds. They fit true to size, they are comfortable and the stone color always gets compliments. Running them through the washing machine makes them look like new. They are my dress sneakers.
I bought these shoes for my upcoming trip to NYC. We'll be doing a lot of walking and I want to be comfortable but not look like a frumpy tourist. I think they'll do well. They run short and narrow, so I ordered a second pair in a half-size larger and they fit well. I'm returning the first pair. They have no arch support, so I'll be adding my own orthotic.
These shoes were true to my size, a 6B. They have a sleek streamlined look that I think, especially in black, gives them a more formal look than the ordinary sneaker. A good shoe at a good price.

These shoes are very comfortable and pretty true to size. They have just enough support for what I need. 
I bought these shoes for my daughter and she loves them. They are comfortable, true to size and make her feet look a size smaller.
