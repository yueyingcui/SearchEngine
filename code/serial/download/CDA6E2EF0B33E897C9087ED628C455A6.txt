Sanuk Chiba
I bought a pair of Chibas in size 13. They were a little tight,but I immediately loved them until my brother in law hit me up for them. So now I will order the 14's I need!
I love these shoes. Finding a shoe I can wear without socks took a long time, but these are they. Comfortable, light, great looking. They do seem to run a little small, so I wear a size larger than I usually wear with other shoes.
Bought these for my husband and he loves them! The fit seemed snug at first but they stretched a little and now he says they're perfect. Size was a little sketchy since there are only wholes and no half sizes, but he wears between a 10 and a 10.5 and I got him a 10 with no worries!
