Nike Zoom Structure+ 15 Breathe
Due to reviews both on this site and Nike's directly, I ordered this shoe in a half size up (8) from my normal running shoe size (7.5). I expected them to be just right, but it turns out the shoes are a bit large. I expect my normal size would be the best one, and will probably order another pair. They do run a bit wide in the toe box, though, which may be the reason that they feel roomier than other running shoes I've owned.
These are supportive running shoes for my flat-ish feet.  For what it's worth, I'm a size 10 and my pair fit true to size.  After reading the other reviews, I tried on the shoe in 10 and 10.5, and my regular size 10 fit perfectly. 
I bought two pairs of these shoes and will probably buy another. For me the best shoe ever. It keeps me from pronating and has good arch support and comfortable fit. I did take a 1/2 size larger.
I love these shoes.  They are super comfy, but they do run about half a size too small.  I wear a size 8.5 running shoe and had originally ordered an 8.5 , but was dissapointed when I got them and they felt tight, so I had to return them.  This time I ordered a size 9 and they fit perfectly!

I would highly recommend ordering these shoes a half size larger than you normally wear for running shoes.  All of my other Nike running shoes are size 8.5 and they fit true to size, so it's this particular style that's a bit off.
