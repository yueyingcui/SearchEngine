Reebok Kids RealFlex Transition (Toddler/Youth)
Son loves them, just has hard time remembering to loosen the shoelaces before trying to pull on- don't know that that is a shoe default- he's just not used to tying shoes yet. Tired converse and many others since for a second pair and somehow the size 3 in converse is smaller than this... again not sure who's "right".
My 8 years old loves these shoes -- we have two pairs. He goes to a private school with a strict uniform policy -- including shoes -- and fit the requirements. A bunch of the boys wear this particular style. My son says they are super comfortable right out of the box -- no breaking in, great for running, and just everyday wear. Fit true to size. I would definitely buy again.
