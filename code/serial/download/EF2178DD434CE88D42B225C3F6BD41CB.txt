Converse Kids Chuck Taylor® All Star® Specialty Ox (Infant/Toddler)
These shoes ran a full size big. I ordered a size 7 for my 26 month old and they were so big. They looked like clown shoes. I have heard this from other parents and I should have listened. I ultimately went with the velco demin colored Converse shoe in a 7 and that particular style was not nearly as big.
