New Balance MX997
I really, really like these shoes.  They are incredibly light, and feel great.

Based on previous New Balance shoes that always seemed more narrow than marked, I ordered wider shoes.
For this model, that proved to be a mistake, as they were too wide for me.  My heel was slipping all over.  In other words, they seem true to size.
