Mizuno Wave® Rally™ 2
Great volleyball shoes! I ordered one size up for my daughter. She usually wears 7.5-8 but I got 8.5 based on comments and they are perfect. Highly recommend - good lateral support.
Great shoe for the price but get a 1 1/2 size bigger; they run small. My daughter wears 4 in regular shoes and had to order 5 1/2 in these volleyball shoes.
