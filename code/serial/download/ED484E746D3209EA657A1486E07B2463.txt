adidas Kids Predito LZ TRX FG (Toddler/Youth)
These soccer shoes are excellent. Both of my boys (6years and 8 years) loved them. Like all Adidas soccer shoes they run a bit small (1 size smaller at least), so you want to make sure you get the right size. But they are really beautiful and confortable on the field.
