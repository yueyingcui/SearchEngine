adidas Kids AX 1 (Toddler/Youth)
Seems to fit exactly as it should - I ordered my daughter one size up - she's an 11 so I ordered a 12 and they are perfect - not too big, but plenty of room to grow. Also, she has a narrow foot and her heel doesn't slip. We've only had them for a couple days so I'm not sure how they will wear over time, but so far, so good. Laces are a little long so I'm having to double knot them every time.
  This pair of shoes were exact to size and arrived so promptly.  The colors are feminine yet sporty and the black toe is perfect for handling the scuffing of an active girl.  I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend!
