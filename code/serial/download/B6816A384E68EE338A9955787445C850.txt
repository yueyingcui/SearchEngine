Reebok ZigNano Fly 2
These are awesome looking shoes but they are very uncomfortable. The plastic around your feet where the laces start is very tight and hurts my feet after about two minutes of wearing them. I even ordered half a size too large and they were still squeezing my feet. That makes me sad. I guess these shoes are just more for looks than comfort. I returned them.
When reading reviews, I always look for the reviews that tell me if a shoe fits true to size. In my opinion, these do. I wear a 9 normally and these 9's fit just fine. As far as looks, these shoes are some of the best looking shoes I have ever owned. I haven't run much in them, so I can't say if they are good running shoes. I have lifted in them and they are comfortable.
