Speedo Toddler SurfwalkerÂ®
They are really cute, but beware - huge difference between sizes. I bought both the M and the L for my daughter who wears an 8.5. The M was almost too small - her toe is against the front. The L she steps clear out of!
My two year old son wears them without any complaints. They are easy to put on and the pull cord helps ensure that they are a snug fit before getting in the water. I have nothing bad to say about them. I am very pleased with this purchase. I will buy them again when he needs a larger size!
My son was a 6 so we couldn't decide on small or medium. Ordered both, it seemed he was just right for the small so we went with it. Only lasted a few weeks, and now we need the medium which are a little too big. The shoes are cute, but i guess they run a little off for perfect sizing. Not true to size, from our experience.
