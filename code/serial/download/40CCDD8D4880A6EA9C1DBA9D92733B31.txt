Globe The Odin
These shoes are amazing! On and off the board, they function better than any shoe I have ridden since the ct-iv's (Chet Thomas' pro model which was Globe's top selling shoe still to this date), these shoes come right up on the ct-iv's on the best, comfortable, best looking shoes I've owned, I've been skateboarding for 10 years and these honestly make me have faith in footwear for skateboarding, if you're a skater looking for that shoe that you remembered when you started with big bulky shoes like es accel's, globe ct-iv's, adio kenny andersons, and shoes since then haven't had that feeling, here you go, these aren't bulky like shoes from the late '90s early '00s, but more on the bulky side with a fit form design along with it, cupsole support with vulcanized functionality, sick looking shoe, for the person who just wants the comfort of a skate shoe for work (which I also wear to work and feel like I'm on clouds), here you go, these are the best shoes Globe has out currently. I know because I've ridden the motley mid's, the eaze (Mark Appleyard's newest pro shoe), the heathan low (David Gonzalez' new shoe - also available in hi) even fusion's before the above, these shoes live up to the name Odin, they are god's design for a skate shoe and instilled the idea to Chris Haslam for us to all enjoy. I 100% stand by these shoes, I'm even going to order another pair of these for nice shoes so I have a nice pair while I skate the others, but I have awhile yet for that because these shoes are the definition of durable. You cannot go wrong with Odin's, or even Globe nonetheless, for skateboarding I advise buying your true size (minimal toe room without hurting feet) for optimal boardfeel, for nice wearing buy whatever size you prefer, these shoes are what you want.
