These shoes are everything I hoped for - super comfortable - true to size, I ordered my exact shoe size & they were a perfect fit! No "breaking in" time and the best part is that they came in 1 day! Ready to wear - they look great with capris, or shorts or skirts...thinking of getting another pair in a different color. Highly recommend these very versatile shoes!
I can't believe others marked these shoes as being "true to size." Mine arrived today and they are absolutely adorable, but way too big. I would say they run at least a size larger than they should -- I'm a pretty standard size 6, and there is a good 1" gap at the back of my heel. I would not even be able to walk and keep these on my feet. I'd love to exchange for a smaller size, but unfortunately they don't come in a 5.5 or 5. My loss, I guess.
These are so great! They look good with bare legs and shorts and with long jeans. They fit true to size and are really comfy.
