Sanuk Plain Jane II
These are a great sandal/shoe!  Just like all Sanuks, they are super comfy. I like this particular design because it is a little more tailored, more feminine. I have size 9 so I like to find shoes that help my feet look like girls feet.
Thank you for the previous post about which size to buy. I'm normally a size 8.5 but Sanuks only come in whole sizes so from the recommendation of the other customer I rounded down and bought a size 8. They fit perfectly. I love these shoes...very comfortable and versatile. I will definitely purchase another pair.
These shoes I would love to be able to wear 24/7. They run 1/2 size smaller, so if you wear an 8 1/2 buy an 8. I find Sanuks to be durable and comfortable.
