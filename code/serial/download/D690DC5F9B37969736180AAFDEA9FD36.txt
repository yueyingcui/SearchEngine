Polo Ralph Lauren Bienne
These are very attractive shoes that fits true to size. They are very similar to Sperry's Topsider but the quality is a notch above, which you would expect from Ralph Lauren. The insoles are fairly flat which is characteristic of all these types of shoes. Improvements could certainly have been made in this regard and resulted in a three star comfort rating, bringing the overall down to a four.
These shoes are sharp! Don't let the red color scare you. It's not as red as it looks in the photo in person. The subtle two tone is a real touch of class. My only issue was that the shoe runs a full size smaller that I expected, so I have to do an exchange. But I like a perfect fit, so it could just be me. Overall, if you love a sharp well crafted leather shoe for the Spring/Summer...this is your shoe!
