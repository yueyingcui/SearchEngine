Nike Kids Lunar Forever (Toddler/Youth)
I bought these for my daughter. She is very tough on her shoes. So far - so good. Fit great. Sturdy. True to size.
Got these shoes for my 10 year old daughter for cheerleading practice. They are very comfortable and fit true to size. Seem to holding up well.
