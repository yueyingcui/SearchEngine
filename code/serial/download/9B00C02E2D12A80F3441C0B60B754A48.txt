I thought they'd sent me a women's size by mistake. I had to double check. I'm not kidding. In most shoes I wear a size 11, med width. In some shoes I'm a 10.5. 

I couldn't even get my feet into the size 11s. I tried size 12 instead. Those fit and I'm keeping them, but even then they are tight in the width and the toe box is too long. If there was a wider style I would have gone with that in an 11.5. I can't imagine what they are thinking with the sizing.

But they look sharp. I got a compliment the first morning I had them on. Like a lot of skate/deck shoes they rub the back of your foot raw until they break in, but after that they are pretty comfortable and feel good to skate in.
