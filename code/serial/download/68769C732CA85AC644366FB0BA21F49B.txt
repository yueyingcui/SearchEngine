Nike Kids Remix Jr (Youth)
These shoes are true to size and fit my child perfectly.They look very nice and he said very comfortable the first day. He did step in a huge mud hole, so I had no choice but to throw them in the washing machine..to my surprise they came out looking like new!
I am an adult, wear a Ladies size 4M, and was unable to find any golf shoes. I purchased these shoes in a size 3, and they fit perfectly when wearing a pair of golf socks. While they may not be the most stylish shoes for an adult, being able to change the inserts to coordinate with my golf "costumes" is an enhancement. Wish Nike had some "hot" colors for the inserts, e.g., lime green, aqua, coral.
These are great golf shoes for a youth! My son loves these shoes. They were true to size and are easy to clean. For the price they are great golf shoes. He says they are very comfortable, and he did not need to break them in. The first day he wore them, they had to walk all 18 holes at the golf course.
My daughter loves these shoes. They are true to size and very comfortable. She loves the fact you can change the color of the Nike logo!
