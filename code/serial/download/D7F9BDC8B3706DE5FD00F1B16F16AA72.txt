New Balance WW927
There was only one pair left in my size. Found upon trying it on that the left shoe wasn't sewn smoothly on the inside seam just above the big toe. Also, I guess this brand runs short in length. Other than that the shoe felt good and felt stable. Had to send back since it was both short and defective. Since I didn't get to walk in them, I can't speak to performance, so I can't rate this shoe.
I have a long, narrow foot and I was looking for an athletic shoe that didn't make my feet look so huge. So, I decided to go for black. This just isn't it. My foot looked absolute huge and chunky. In terms of fit, I find that athletic shoes tend to run a half size smaller than what I would buy in other styles. That seemed to be the case with this shoe as well. I returned these and will try another shoe. Thanks for making it easy to do that.

I love New Balance shoes and am always happy with their fit and comfort. I have a hard size to find and New Balance always has it.
I have a wide foot, and finding a good fit is often hard.  New Balance is one of the few brands that offers many styles with a wide option.  These shoes are very comfortable; I can wear them all day without any problem.  They seem true to size.  I would buy them again!
I have bunions which require me to wear EE width, as anyone with this issue knows it's virtually impossible to find comfortable shoes. I was ecstatic when I found these shoes. They were extremely comfy and true to size, I'm on my feet a lot so that's very important. However, after just a few months the shoes started to curl at the toes, very uncomfortable. The sole actually split at the ball of my shoe. This was my second and last pair. I was very disappointed.
This shoe is leather which makes it less hot. I ordered my usual size 10 narrow, but had to exchange it for 9.5 because it ran a bit large.
