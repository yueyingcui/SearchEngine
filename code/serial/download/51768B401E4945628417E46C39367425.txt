SKECHERS Anchor-Cast Off
Wow are these things cute on, and with a pair of capri's you'll look adorable.   They're boat shoes so they're very flat, and no arch support, but they are so soft and comfortable.  I'll love wearing these things out, but will be sad when I do.  They're a great alternative to the Sperrys that I wanted but were unavailable in my size.  Get 'em!
