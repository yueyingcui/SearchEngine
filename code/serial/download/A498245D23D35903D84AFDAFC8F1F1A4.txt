Brooks Kids Adrenaline GTS (Youth)
I bought these shoes in kids size for myself. The online chat person told me which size to order. I did have to return the first pair and size up a half size, but they are now perfect! I took them with me on a trip to New York City and they were so comfortable walking all over the city. I have a bunion, so it's hard to find good, fun, comfortable shoes. Love these!
I wear a child's size 2 and search everywhere for a comfortable running shoe with support and no blinking lights! My search is over! The moment I put these shoes on they were great! So comfy and great support! I will never waste money on the other running shoes... I have found the best after 40 some years of searching!
