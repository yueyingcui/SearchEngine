New Balance W730v1
I am absolutely in love with these sneakers. I am on my feet most of the day and these give me long lasting comfort. They are very breathable and extremely lightweight. My only concern is that they do not have an insole, which I at first I thought I received a defective pair. Since they are very breathable I do not think this will be a problem, but is something to consider if you do like to remove insoles to wash them. They felt fairly true to size, maybe a little bit smaller than the average sneaker I have tried, but I wouldn't consider it a half size smaller. I am usually a 5 and 1/2 in flats and a size 6 in these fits well with a little bit of room with is great for me since my feet seem to swell as the day goes on. I would highly recommend these to any one that is looking for a well styled, comfortable every day sneak!
I'd spent almost the entire summer looking for a new pair of walking/hiking shoes - literally going through 13 different pairs before finding these on a fluke. They run true to size and are incredibly comfortable due to the wide toe box. There is no arch support, so if you're looking for big squishy shoes these aren't them. They're quite minimalist and light and breathable. So far I love them, and will be buying another pair!
I live these shoes. My feet used to hurt until I bought these. They run a little big so I had to order a size down. I wet them without socks and they don't smell. Feel great, I over pronate and they help with that. 
Wow, not sized correctly.  I am a 7.5-8 and can handle an 8-8.5 running shoe with socks but these Size 8s are more like a 9.
