New Balance MX608V2
After waiting over 2 months for notification of  my size EE wide to come in, I finally ordered a pair of 4EE.  To my  surprise they fit perfectly so I assume that these shoes run a little on the narrow side.  Other than that I am very happy with them.
This purchase couldn't have been easier, much easier than going to the mall iF you know your exact size and the style you want. Product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Size was perfect. No complaints, and lots of satisfaction.
Still a bit early to tell. Need to be broken in, but I have a significant size and width difference between feet, but so far so good.
I work in the food service industry. I wear lightweight running sneakers while not at work. These sneakers/work shoes are lighter than most slip resistant shoes which I like. They were comfortable to wear almost immediately. They are a bit warm - good in winter not so good in hot kitchens. Although they are slip resistant I find they are not the best on wet floors. Fit was true to my size.
