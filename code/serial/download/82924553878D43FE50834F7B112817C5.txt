The North Face Women's Tyndall
Great hiking shoes - super comfortable and durable. Although on very rocky hikes I kind of regret getting the high top ones for the ankle support. I am also usually an 8 but had to go up a size and the 8.5 felt much better.
These are amazing! Rarely do I find a shoe that fits so well immediately. It fits totally true to size, is breathable and looks cool. Love it, love it!
This shoe seems to run small - 1/2 to full size smaller in length. I love that it is short around the ankles so it doesn't dig in. I found the width true to size through the toes but a little smaller over the arch. I do have a high arch and the sides of the shoes barely cover the tongue in this area. Overall I really like them for walking and exercising. They give support without cutting in anywhere.
These are great shoes - lightweight and super comfy. They are just a hair shorter than I'd like but not worth going up a whole size, which I'd have to do since I'm at a 10.
I usually wear a size 5 1/2. When these arrived, I found they were just a bit too snug for my socks. Sent them back (hassle-free!) and ordered a 6. Perfect! Comfortable shoes, and they have great treads.
