Keen Austin
Ordered one pair, fit perfect. Second pair were one size small... The ones I do wear are NOT waterproof. Not sure if I will take chance on third pair. Will see...
I love these shoes - they are comfortable and durable and versatile. I have worn them for the past 5 or 6 years. My only complaint is that the toebox does not seem as wide as it used to be on the mens 10.5 size.
These are my first pair of Keens. I ordered these along with a Merrell and a Born on the recommendation of my orthopedic specialist due to some foot pain I'm dealing with. These were the best of the three in arch support and heel stability. I have very tall arches and these shoes feel full and supportive under the arch, which is a rare find. I also tend to pronate and the heel box of this shoe is very secure and solid feeling. The heel height feels lower -- possibly due to the extra arch support -- making the shoe feel geared toward a mid-foot strike. The advantage of this is less impact on the knees and hips while walking. The toe box is a little extra-wide and roomy, and the length of the shoe is true to size.
Very comfortable. I bought the same size as another pair of Keens and these were 1/2 size larger. 
There is something wrong with me. I've never been into clothes or shoes. I usually bought my shoes at JL Coombs in Freeport from the discount rack. Blemished, seconds, whatever. Had a great pair of LL Bean shoes that I resoled and re-soled for a decade. Then my fiancee suggested I get a pair of these hideous looking "Keens". I bought the Austins, black, size 10.5 One year later: I own 5 pairs...I'm turning into the Imelda Marcos of Keens, and I'm a straight guy. I just ordered another pair of sandals, and when the soles started showing wear on my original Austins and they couldn't re-sole them, Keen said I could get another pair. I've never worn anything on my feet so comfortable. I wake up in the morning and I can't wait to put on a pair. How is that for an endorsement?
