Reef Ocean Mist
They are very comfortable shoes, with a very strong rubber smell but it doesn't hurt the look or feel. They are 1/2 size big. I'm usually a 6.5 but had to order 6 and I like to wear them without the shoe lace because they are a bit too long.
These definitely run big. I'm a true 6.5 but the ones I ordered was way too big. I can't decide if it's a dull size or half size bigger yet. Inside heel has great support and cushion but arch support is just moderate.
