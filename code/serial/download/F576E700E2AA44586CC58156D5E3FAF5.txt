inov-8 Terrafly™ 287 GORE-TEX®
Although pure road shoes are better on paved surface this shoe can be used for both trails and road, especially if you will be on a road for a short distances. Comfortable, but you need to buy 1/2 size larger in comparison to your other running shoes, especially if you are running long distances (more than 20 miles in one time).
They fit true to size for me, but certainly needed some breaking in. They gave my feet blisters the first time I tried to run in them. I suggest washing them prior to wearing them for your first run. Overall, great shoe for rockier trails. I also wear the f-lite 230s and like them as well. I wear those for smoother trails. 
I purchase Terrafly because I experience the inov-8 230 Lite (I can be all day on them and my feet don't hurt). I'm a size 7 and ordered 7.5; it was good for the first 2 miles - after 4 hours my feet started to hurt. I will recommend to buy a full size up.
