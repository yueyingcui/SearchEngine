I was pleasantly surprised by this great little pair of sneakers. I was just expecting a basic navy canvas shoe that I can schlep around the grimy streets of NYC in, but the cut and the detailing make these shoes a little more elevated than my normal Vans Authentics or Chuck Taylors. They come to just below the ankle on me, and look great with both jeans and shorts. They are about as cushy and supportive as the thin soles will allow, but I haven't had any pain or discomfort yet and I've been wearing them for about a month. I will say that the color is a little less navy and more royal than in the photo, and I think they run on the smaller side of my 7.5 size. All in all a very cute and versatile shoe, I just wish they were available in other colors!
