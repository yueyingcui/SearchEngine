Ryka radiantâ„¢
Most comfortable pair of walking shoes I have ever owned. They are lightweight with great padding and arch support. Like the mesh upper. Ryka's always fit my feet better than other brands with less slippage in the heels. They do tend to run about a half size small so I would recommend ordering up by a half size.
I saw that this walking shoe got 5 stars and everyone raved about them. They are nice, but I only gave them 4 stars for the following reasons: 1) they are a little short. If you are on the top end of your shoe size, order a 1/2 size up 2) they are definitely breathable! I think they'd be great for indoor walking, or walking in the spring or summer, but for outdoor walking in the fall or winter, your feet might get a little chilled 3) I found there wasn't enough padding for the balls of my feet. I plan on keeping the shoes, because they're not awful, but next time I'll go back to New Balance.
The radiant is a very comfortable shoe, purchased .5 size larger, great fit, lots of padding, good arch support.
Best walking shoes I've ever had.  Comfortable right out of the box.  Bought 1/2 size larger to allow for socks.  Wide fore foot and narrow heel is like custom fit for my hard to fit feet.
