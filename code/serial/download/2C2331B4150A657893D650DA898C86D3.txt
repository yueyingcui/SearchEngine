Keds Champion Slip-On - Canvas
Nice shoe, but fits funny.  Really tight in the arch area, like the shoe has been made for a long, slender, low-profile foot.  You may have to go a size up, but then you'll have a ton of dead space in the toe.  Too bad; I really like this return of a classic for men.
