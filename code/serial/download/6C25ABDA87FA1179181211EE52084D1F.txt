Palladium Pampa Oxford
I purchased these to replace an old pair of Palladium Pampa Oxfords that I have had for over 20 years. I hung on to them in spite of the fact that they are a size too small. I love these shoes. The new pair are about Â¼" narrower, but have a better food pad with arch support. I think I like the wider look of my old pair, but I do appreciate the new foot pad. These are great shoes! I cannot wait to take them with me on my next outdoor adventure
