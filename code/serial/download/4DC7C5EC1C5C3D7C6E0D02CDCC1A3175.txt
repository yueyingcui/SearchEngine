Roper Performance Slip On
After careful research I chose to purchase these shoes as my general use travel shoes, and I couldn't be happier. They slip on and off very easily, are extremely comfortable, and after going to a convention for a week, walking 20 miles a day in them, at the end of the day my feet weren't tired at all and a new first for me! These shoes are awesome and I recommend them for any heavy traveler! The only one nitpick I have is I should have gotten them a half size or so smaller. Once they broke in some, it felt like there was a little too much 'sliding' in them as I was walking, but it never caused a blister or anything so I'm going to keep them as it is. :)
Another satisfied customer - 
This is an excellent shoe. The quality is more than I expected, but they were a half size larger and a bit narrower than expected. I would highly recommend this shoe to anyone who likes Keen shoes.

Unfortunately the shoes did not fit. I believe the size was a little narrower than I had anticipated.
