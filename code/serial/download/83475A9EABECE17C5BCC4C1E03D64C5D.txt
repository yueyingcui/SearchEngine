New Balance BB907
I bought these for my 12yr. old son. I ordered the wrong size at first but exchanged for smaller size. My son said they are very comfortable. He needed a very supportive shoe because he has hip dyplasia and uses an insert with all of his shoes. These were able to accommodate an insert and perform the way he needed. 

I was advised to go a 1/2 size larger than normal by a friend who recommended New Balance. It was a good recommendation. I'm impressed by the comfort. Style is okay but I strictly use these for playing pickup recreational basketball games.
Purchased this shoe to try to prevent ankle re-injury. Shoe is a little hard to pull on without loosening the laces a lot but provides good ankle support. Wasn't long until they were broken in and very comfortable, though this did cause the front of the shoe to disfigure slightly. Due to the large size I need, the molded white front is big, notable and took awhile to get used to. It looks good though and is comfortable. Very pleased overall.
Great shoes. Bought these for my husband for basketball, kickboxing and other cross-training. Tough to find good ankle support in a not-too funky design. These are true to size in wide and my husband loves them.
