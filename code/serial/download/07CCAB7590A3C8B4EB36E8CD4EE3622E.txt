Vans Rata Vulc
This is my third pair of Ratas and I'm hooked. Their look is unique without straying too far from the Vans style profile and they work well with shorts, khakis, or jeans. These are by far the most comfy Vans without socks. Be advised: they stretch about a half size (especially the hemp version) so order down. I'm normally a 10.5 and have always gotten these in 10.
Super comfortable casual shoe. I'm a little skeptical of the durability, but then again, they're under my budget! I wear a size 10 running shoe, size 8 1/2 Converse All-Star and the size 9 in this Rata Vulc is perfect.
After three attempts at Vans for our daughter, who has wide feet, these were perfect. We got half a size bigger and there is enough room to grow, without making her feet look big. We will definitely buy other pair when these wear out.
These shoes are great! They formed to my foot within a day. They're soft and go well casual or dressed up. The suede ones are really nice too. They fit true to size.

I have worn Vans for YEARS because of the great fit and QUALITY. All three of the Vans I just received are poor quality material and not true to their usual size and cut. Too narrow at the toes and not as deep. Also, the sole is of a different material. I will not buy Vans again unless I can try them on first.
