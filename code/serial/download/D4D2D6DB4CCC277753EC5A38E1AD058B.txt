TIC TAC TOES Lola
I like them! I got these because I liked the look, not for dancing. They have that slightly tailored, but edgy menswear look with a feminine twist. The leather is somewhat thin, so they don't look super expensive, which they aren't. But they are attractive and comfortable, true to size. Good for all day office wear.
Lightweight easy to wear shoe.  True to size.  Just what I was looking for this fall.
