Tsukihoshi Kids Baby Arisa (Infant/Toddler)
Really happy with these shoes. They run true to size to a little bit big, in my experience. The width is definitely a true Medium, they are neither wide nor narrow. My toddler has pretty narrow feet which can make finding shoes difficult but this style of shoe is adjustable so they fit well. Most importantly they are very light, well constructed, and the sole has plenty of flexibility in it which is important in a toddler shoe. They are totally adorable, and the gold makes them go with everything while still being very eye-catching and cute. We get compliments all the time. Tsukihoshi is a great brand for toddler shoes and I have never regretted buying them for either of my two kids.
These are great shoes for new walkers. They seem very comfortable and my granddaughter likes to wear them. I did have to get them in the wide size instead of the medium as they were snug across the toes.
