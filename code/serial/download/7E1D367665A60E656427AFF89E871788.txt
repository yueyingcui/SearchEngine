New Balance MWM756
These are extraoordinaly comfortable and are very true to size. These shoes provide excellent support but seem as light as a feather. I am actually reluctnat to take them off.
Needed new slip on shoes I liked my black New Balance. They sell brown only so that's what I went with. Bought my normal size 11.5 M. Way too tight, returned for 12 M. These were a little loose but much better. Great service!
If your foot is even a little over your usual size, they are tight. I always wear a 12 and the 12 in these is too small. Otherwise they rock! But I have to return them.
Very comfortable -- good for brisk walks or all day wear. The styling sets these apart just enough from the typical "moc" look...just make sure you buy a half-size up.
