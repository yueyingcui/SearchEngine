Speedo Coast Cruiser
I went up a size and these still felt small. If you are buying these for in the pool, don't! They are not for tile or other hard, smooth surfaces--very slippery. I'm thinking they are probably fine for sand and sea.
I normally take a size 9, but a Speedo Coast Cruiser size 9 was just too small. I returned the size 9, got a size 10, and the 10 fits much much better.
