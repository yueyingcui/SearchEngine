New Balance MW812 Hook-and-Loop
I bought these for my 84 year old father who has Alzheimer's Disease and has difficulty tying but wants to walk all the time. They fit right out of the box and he is thrilled with them. I would have ordered white also but they aren't available. it is nearly impossible to buy narrow sizes and then velcro too!
These shoes felt great right out of the box. I wear orthotics due to foot problems, and these are roomy enough for the orthotics and my high instep. I bought the 2E width, which was perfect for my wider-than-average feet. These are very true to size. The "rollbar" and "walking strike path" features give the shoes stability than you can feel when walking. A great shoe and made in USA!
Shoes arrived next day and had no defects. Shoe size fit me perfectly. Velcro fasteners are great for those with disabilities or hand arthritis. Velcro straps didn't come undone when used all day. I use these shoes only indoors.
