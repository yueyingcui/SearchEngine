Sanuk Athena
I was so disappointed with these. My shoe size is generally a 7.5, so I ordered both the 7 and 8 in the Athena. I already own Sanuk flip flops (size 8), so I was expecting the same comfortable feel. Instead, my big toe kept catching on the inside of the shoe's hefty front seam. They were big enough -- that wasn't the problem -- it was just that the seam sort of hung down into the shoe. Loved how they looked. Hated how they felt. Both sizes returned. Bummer.
I love the sandals. I get many, many complements on them because they are different. I usually wear a size 6 1/2. I ordered a 7 and they fit perfectly. Once again, ZAPPOS is the best!!!
