RJ Colt Tindle
Great boat/moccasin shoe. Nice feel to the leather and has some style about it as well. Comfortable insert adds a lot more support and comfort than expected. Nice split sole with a bit of support. Comfortable out of the box. Seems to run a bit large, 8 is the smallest they offer and I probably would absolutely love a 7 1/2 but the size difference was manageable since I enjoyed the shoe so much. Good purchase all around, if you gauge the sizing correctly you won't be disappointed.
