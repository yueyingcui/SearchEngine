Nice shoes, but really run small. I usually wear an 8, but these were too short in 8-1/2. I returned both 8 and 8-1/2 for a size 9.


I normally buy New Balance athletic shoes but after receiving some mocking from my wife and daughter about wearing "Dad Shoes", I looked around and found these. I ordered the same size as I would with New Balance and these fit the same. They are comfortable and look good. Very little breaking in required.
I normally wear a size 12, so I ordered these in 12 also. I returned them because they felt too small. Also, they felt more like a brick and didn't seem to have much cushioning.
I have wide feet so I needed 4e. I also noted from other reviews to order at 1/2 size larger than my actual foot size. I ordered a size 12 4E. These fit well out of the box and were very comfortable wearing to my retail job where I'm on my feet for a full shift every day.
