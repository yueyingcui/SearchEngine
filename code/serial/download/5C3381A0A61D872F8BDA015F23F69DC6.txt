School Issue Athletic H&L (Toddler/Youth)
Really liked this shoe because of its fit, style and the fact that it appears to be very well made. Sometimes it's nice just to put a basic white shoe on a kid especially with the velcro straps. It's easy for parents and the kids to put on themselves. Overall, this was a great value for the price and I would definitely buy again when we need to go up a size. I've bought a lot of Stride Rite and Sperry but this is definitely superior!
