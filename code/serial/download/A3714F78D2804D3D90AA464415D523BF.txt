Puma Kids V5.11 TT Jr (Toddler/Youth)
I ordered my daughter the 4 youths. She normally wears a 3½ youth or 5½ women's. We ordered up half a size for her to possibly wear two pairs of socks due to her field hockey shin guards. Thin ones under, then the guards which have the under the foot strap, then the big socks that go over. These shoes were so tight in the toes that with just the thin socks she could barely get them on. Perhaps these are more like a women's sizing? The styling is great though and we are ordering another pair. They are shiny, which may not be very apparent in the pictures. She loves them, and is looking forward to a pair that fits.
