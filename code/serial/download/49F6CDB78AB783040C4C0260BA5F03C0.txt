adidas Kids STA Fluid CF I (Infant/Toddler)
I bought these shoes in hot pink for my 3 1/2 year old daughter.  She has a wide foot so I bought them in the wide size.  They are super comfortable and breathable and she had no problems with fit. She has to have a durable shoe to wear to preschool and these shoes fit that bill. They are also really, really cute!
Awesome shoe!  Flexible, breathable, comfortable and super cute!  I've already ordered the next size up!
Nice looking shoes, but fit a full size under what my daughter wears.  Ordered the next full size up.
