adidas Originals Kids SambaÂ®  Leather (Youth)
These shoes are great. I bought them for myself because I have small feet and the children's size is what fit me. I think I might have gotten a size slightly too big actually, but it hasn't bothered me. They seem to be well constructed and are light and comfy. One tiny drawback is that they squeak when I walk but I imagine that this will go away after time. It's probably just the brand spanking new leather that makes this noise. I wear these on a daily basis walking around my city while I push the stroller and hang out at the park with my kids. They are working out great and I love the way the look.
This model is made of something called 'leather coating', not as soft as the others, and sized smaller.
The shoe is a classic and loved by my 9 year old. It runs a little bit narrow so we went up a 1/2 size. The first pair he had wore out at the top of the shoe.
I got these for my wife and she loves them. I originally order a half a size larger (against her wishes) and had to return them for the size that she originally wanted. The return was a breeze and the new pair arrived the day after they received the returned pair.
