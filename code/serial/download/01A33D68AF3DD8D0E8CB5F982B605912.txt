Twig Kids Ozzie II (Toddler/Youth)
From what I can tell, these look like very well made shoes. These have "hook and loop" velcro closures. I did notice that one of the "loops" was very difficult to pull through the "hook" to tighten the strap. These might be better designed if the loop was separated into two straps, with separate velcro closures. My son keeps them at school and only wears them there, so I have not seem him in them. I haven't heard any complaints from him, and when I ask how he likes them, he says they are "good". He's 5 1/2 and I bought him size US 1.5-2. He usually wears a size 1 or 2 depending on the shoe (he is probably measuring closer to a US!). These seem like they have plenty of growing room for him. I like the rubber lug soles. They seem like they would be great on the playground too. I needed a shoe that would be easy for my son to put on and take off by himself at school and these seem to work. The styling is super!
