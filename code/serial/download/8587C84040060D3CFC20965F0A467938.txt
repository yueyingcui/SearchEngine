PUMA TX-3
As other reviewers say, order a 1/2 size larger than your normal size for a perfect fit.  These shoes mold to your feet and are more supportive than most Puma footwear.  Glad Puma decided to bring these back! 
Excellent - 
I love all Puma shoes and this one in particular is perfect for walking in the snow. Super comfortable and true to size.

Nice, simple, stylish shoe - 
This shoe feels roomy for my shoe size. They are extremely light and breathable. You can feel a slight draft on the top of the toes in strong wind. They also have some reflective parts that show up shiny in the dark. I think this shoe is very comfortable for casual wear, don't think it is supportive enough for serious running. I agree with a previous reviewer, the colors do look different online than in real life.
