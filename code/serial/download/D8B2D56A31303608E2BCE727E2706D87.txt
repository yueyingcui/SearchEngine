adidas Golf adiPUREâ„¢ Z
These shoes are great looking and their performance is awesome.  They fit snugly, so if you like your shoes with some room in them go a half size up.  With thin half socks you should be true to size.
By far the most comfortable golf shoe I have ever worn.  I used to play in Foot Joy but this shoe has a near custom fit.  Very stylish and helps hide the length of  my foot (size 14).
