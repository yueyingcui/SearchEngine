Vans Kids Authentic Crib (Infant)
These shoes are super cute but they run rather small and narrow. I bought some for my daughter but I had to send them back because her foot was just too fat. She's currently in a size 3 to 4 (depending on length) but we couldn't even get her foot all the way inside. When buying these shoes, I would definitely consider getting them 1 size larger.
These are the cutest little suede infant crib shoe! Vans is a great brand; however, they are cut somewhat small. My daughter wears an infant size 2 in every other major brand but these in a size 2...she wore them twice! They are too tight to work with...but again super cute!
