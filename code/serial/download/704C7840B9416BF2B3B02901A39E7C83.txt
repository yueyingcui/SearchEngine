Keen Ambler Mesh
First, note that I am a big Keen shoes fan. All of my current shoes are Keens. However, I felt that Ambler Mesh did not quite reach the usual high Keen standard. They are too small for their size. I compared these to my Keen Voyageur, and Amblers are a good half size smaller (for the same nominal size 10). They are somewhat narrow in the forward part, in particular mid-front. I have relatively narrow feet, but Amblers still felt a bit too snug. I guess they may become looser with wear. The mesh material is quite shiny - something the images on this site do not reflect. In my opinion this makes these shoes look cheap by comparison. The overall style is nice, and leather version probably would look better. I only tried them out in the house. These shoes are light, lighter than my Voyageurs. However, they did not feel as airy. I am not sure how well the mesh surface would actually breathe. They are going back and I will either go for a new pair of Voyageurs or, may be, try Alamosas.
