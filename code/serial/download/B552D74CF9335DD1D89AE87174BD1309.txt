Five Ten Chase
These shoes are a bit difficult to review. Very well built, obviously designed to be treated harshly. Excellent grip on anything I've attempted to put my feet on. Great shock absorption; does not require an additional insole. Yet almost every strength seems to have a weakness associated with it. The sturdy build makes the shoe feel a bit bulky. I've grown accustomed to light runners that almost disappear on my feet, so I really feel them. The shoes are fairly light in actual weight, just bulky. Grippy rubber sole makes the shoe loud. Added shock absorption means they're stiff, making them poor shoes to actually run in. Ok in sprint bursts, no good for any sort of sustained running. Too stiff. I tend to practice parkour more than I freerun. 5-star freerunning shoe. Great for hard landings, tough precisions and catching bars. Like foot armor, almost. Not so great for actual parkour, which requires an added level of agility and physical efficiency that this shoe cannot provide. No bend at the toes, which causes me to think about my approach, rather that react. I prefer my F-lites for pure parkour. Still love the 5-10's and use them accordingly. Best shoes for walls. Great for trying new stuff. Your feet feel safe with them on. Also, I got them a half size bigger since the toe box is a bit narrow. Hope I help.
Got this in a 1/2 size larger than my regular shoes, and is way too narrow in the forefoot. Great shoe otherwise, but my toes started to go numb after wearing these for about 20 minutes around the house. The next size up would most likely be too long, so they must go back. Very disappointing.
