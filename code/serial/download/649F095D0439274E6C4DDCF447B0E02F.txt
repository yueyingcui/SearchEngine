I may have given more stars if my son were able to wear these shoes when they were developmentally appropriate. I ordered the 6-12months before he was first learning to walk. They are the equivalent to about a size 4 in most other toddler shoes. My son must have smaller than average feet, because he didn't finally grow into these until after his 1st birthday. At this point, I felt as if they weren't appropriate for his walking ability and he needed the next stage of sole. Also, he did walk around in these a few times after they finally fit and the smooth, slippery leather bottom is not very conducive to walking on smooth surfaces like wood or tile. He was slipping all over, so I don't know how you would expect a child to learn to walk in these. The fit on these are good for chubby feet without being too wide. I would stick with Stride Rites where you can have a numerical size to compare to other brands your child is wearing when ordering online.
I ordered these shoes for my 14 month old who hates shoes and has chubby feet. (They are sized at 18-24 months.) They fit perfectly! The bottom of the shoes are a little slippery on my tile floor but over all my little one and I love them! Easy on and off and they match with everything!
