Pearl Izumi Womens All-Road
I only sized up a half size and they were fine.  They didn't run that small! Like the other reviews said with a whole size.
As other reviewers commented, these shoes run small. I wear a size 8 and I purchased the size 40. They felt a little short, like they were 7½. I returned them and ordered the 40½ so hopefully they will be just right. They are really cute and stylish for this type of shoe. It is difficult to figure out one's size, though. The ones I bought said they were like a US size, "8.37" whatever that means since we have no such size in the US. I thought they would be slightly larger than an 8, but smaller than an 8½. If you wear a size 7½, I think the 40 might work for you.
At least a full size to small. I used the scale suggested for conversion from EU to US sizing. I'm a solid 8.5, and I usually go up to a 9 for any workout shoe, sometimes a 9.5 in running shoes. I bought the 39.0 for this biking shoe...way too small...closer to a 7 if I had to guess. Love the style of the Pearl I's...have 2 pair of the running shoes that run very true to size so this was a bit of a shock. I teach spinning, needed a good shoe for indoor cycling. Scared to order again, as I wouldn't know where to begin?! Construction looks great, style is beautiful and functional...size is just so far off the mark, they are going back tomorrow. Very sad.
