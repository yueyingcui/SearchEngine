New Balance Kids KJ633 (Youth)
These shoes seem fine--my kid isn't complaining. At first, he said they were tight at the top of the foot, but I think that has resolved with time. My only complaint--for the previous pair I bought just like these--is that the sole wore out under the big toe, but it took about 5 months and by then my son had just about outgrown the shoes. I think it's more a matter of hard play (4-square) than defective shoes. I also bought a larger size for my other son, and he doesn't have any complaints, either.
