New Balance MO1521
I was looking for waterproof shoes that don't weigh a ton. My size 10s weigh only 14 1/2 ounce each. These shoes were true to size and needed no break-in -- are very comfortable. Time will tell if the waterproofing holds.
4E width good - length 1 size too small. Shoes feel good once size was corrected.
I bought these for my husband, and he absolutely loves them. They are very comfortable. He was not accustomed to wearing Vibram soles, but their added security made many activities possible as he was recovering from an injury. Now he swears by the shoes and wants me to buy a second pair to have when these eventually wear out, even if that is a long time from now. Be careful though because they do run small for the size. He has to wear a half size larger than usual.
I bought a size 13, and it felt like a 12. I returned them and ordered a 14, and it fit perfectly. The problem was across the toe box.
