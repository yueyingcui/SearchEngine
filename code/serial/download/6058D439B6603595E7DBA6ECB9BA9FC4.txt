The Cool People Wolfcot
These shoes run a bit small. I wear half a size up. I would not say that they are the best of shoes, but for my work needs, they work fine. The construction is probably a 6 or 7 out of 10. I wear insoles due to the fact their insoles are not too comfortable. Although they have a side zipper, I still find the need to lace/unlace to wear them. The style for me looks sharp
