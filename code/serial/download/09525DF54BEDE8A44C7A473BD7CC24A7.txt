Columbia Talus Ridge Low OutdryÂ® LTR
My true fit is 11. In this type of shoe my normal size is 1/2 to a full size larger (11.5 or 12) than my true fit. I ordered the 11.5 and 12. I tried on the 12 first. It fit too short. The problem I ran into is that the shoe doesn't come in half sizes over 12. A big negative in my case. For the last several years, I've purchased Asolo. They canceled the style I wanted, which is very similar to the this pair of shoes. I feel Asolo is a better shoe, but I was willing to settle.
