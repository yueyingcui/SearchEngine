Bloch Apex Mid
The style itself was cute, but seemed like it was cheaply made. The sole looked as though it had been worn to hundreds of classes already. I ordered a full size up and could not even wiggle my toes. Sending them back as soon as my return label prints.
Great shoe, but had to return it...it ran at least 1/2 size too short. I am a true 10 so could not go up a size. Used to always wear black Avias for aerobics, but they don't seem to make them anymore...searching for the perfect replacement.
I bought this shoe for Jazzercise and I love it. It's very light and has great support. The sole has a nice large pivot area making turns and transitions easy.
This shoe runs small so I bought the next half size up and the fit is great.
Great dance fitness sneaker. Fantastic support and very comfortable! They do run a little narrow so if you have wide feet, go up a half size.
