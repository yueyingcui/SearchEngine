etnies Fader
I like these shoes, they're comfortable to walk in.  My only complaint is that after kneeling a couple of times, the material on the side of both shoes started to bend inward (as is normal) but put pressure on both of my feet until it was actually painful.  I have to take the shoes off and push the inside back out to fix it.  I don't know if other people have this same problem or maybe it is because I wear a large size (13).
I originally ordered a 7.5 but it felt a half size small so I returned it with no problems at all and received the size 8's before I even returned the 7.5's. The size 8 feels great and comfy.

Purchased these shoes for my husband; he's got huge feet so a size 14 is the one I got. He wears them daily and says they are so comfortable. Etnies are a wonderful brand and really hold up to some abuse. I would definitely recommend buying these.
