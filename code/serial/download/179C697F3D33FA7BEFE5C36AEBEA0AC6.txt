adidas Originals SambaÂ® Canvas
I balked at ordering a man's 7.5 woman's 8.5 thinking I usually take a man's 7 but the fit is exact so do not waver from size chart. I have a B to narrow foot, so these will be too narrow for a wide foot - FYI. The look is so very retro and fun - got the black w/ red. Also the fact that the sole is beige will not show dirt and grass stains as readily as white sole. The heel back is not too high, although from the pix was worried it may be. Love 'em Samba!
I just ordered these in the black/high energy. It looks orange, kind of neon orange. These kicks are sick. The canvas feels great, and the shoe fits true to size. I dig the gum sole, shouldn't get dirty as fast as the basic white sole on many sneakers. I plan on rocking these hard at AT&T when I see the Giants play. They also fit nicely with pants, pants don't tend to bunch up on top of these like many other sneakers. Definitely recommend these shoes.
As a teenager, I loved my sambas! When I went vegan, I mourned that I could no longer buy them in good conscience since at the time, they were all leather. Lo and behold, the samba canvas! I was elated when I discovered these. Ordered the black/high energy/white ones for my birthday and couldn't be more pleased. Super comfortable, cushioned enough for walking around a lot - a great everyday shoe. Really solid color scheme, too! I normally wear a 7.5 in women's, ordered the same here and they fit true to size. Not too narrow and didn't take long to break in! So happy.
