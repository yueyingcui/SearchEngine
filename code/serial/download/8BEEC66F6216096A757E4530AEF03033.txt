Love these shoes. Comfortable, stylish what could be better? I bought a half size smaller since I would be wearing them with thin socks or without socks.
Wear size 7.5 to 8 so I decided to order both sizes to see which one fit better. Deciced to keep the 7.5 as I plan to wear them with no socks and the size 8 were just a little to big. Very cute and comfortable. Can't wait to wear them!
