PUMA Cell Turin Perf 2
These are sharp looking, comfortable shoes. I normally wear 12 in Nike and New Balance. But I needed to get a 13 for these to feel good in the toe. The material is very flexible and I can move my toes around freely. There is not a ton of cushioning like running shoes. The soles are not oversized like most athletic shoes out there, so there is not as much impact cushioning. My feet stay dry all day wearing these, so they do breathe well. It is almost 100Â° out here, but my feet are dry and cool.
