New Balance WW535
Great, lightweight, comfortable walking shoe. Not nearly as clunky looking as others I ordered and returned, but also probably on the light side in terms of support. Walked 3 miles in the heat the first time I put them on, totally comfortable. Runs a little small, I ordered 1/2 size up and they are perfect. I have a narrow foot and they can be cinched up to fit well.
