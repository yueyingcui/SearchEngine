Stride Rite X-Celeracersâ„¢ X-Othermal (Youth)
A few weeks ago I bought these shoes, which I thought fit fine, for my grandson. Then, he started complaining about the shoes being too tight across the balls of his feet. So, I took him and these shoes to a local Stride Rite outlet store (there are no regular Stride Rite stores in my area) to get professionally fitted for a new pair of shoes and get an opinion as to why these shoes (supposedly his correct size) did not seem to fit. The sales person measured his feet (both size 12.5 and width between M and W). She said that these size 12.5W shoes were too short for him and pushing his feet backwards into the shoe, causing pressure on the balls of his feet. She said the main problem with these shoes is they run about a 1/2 size short, so if you buy the size your child's feet measure, the shoes will be too small right from the beginning. In these shoes, a 13W would have just fit my grandson with almost no growing room and a size 13.5W would have fit him with the usual amount of growing space Stride Rite typically fits kids with. Also, according to the sales person, the shorter a shoe runs, the more narrow it runs, because the width is in proportion to the length. I ended up buying my grandson 2 different pairs of size 12.5W Stride Rite sneakers, which both have a little growing room.
