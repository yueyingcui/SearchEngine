ASICS GEL-Volley Eliteâ„¢
I am an avid volleyball player having played year round for the past eleven years, and for my high school and college teams the past eight. My first two pairs of Asics volleyball shoes were wonderful (sturdy, well-fit, comfortable, and high performance), but my last pair I liked a lot less as Asics seemed to switch to a more rigid design that did not conform to the foot at all. This new model is much closer to the original models that I loved so much. It is much more flexible and much lighter than the Sensei 3/4, very comfortable, and still has a sturdy, gripping outsole. The one thing I would caution people about is that the outsole is actually somewhat rounded, which is a clear departure from just about every other volleyball shoe I have ever worn. It takes some getting used to, but I have grown to like it as my lateral movement seems quicker and easier. The shoe seems true to size (I have a skinny foot and it is a little wide on me, but is flexible enough it can be tightened down reasonably far). Overall, I would suggest giving this shoe a try because its comfort and unique design are unlike any other volleyball shoes on the market right now. It is lighter than the other Asics, but still heavier than the Mizuno shoes so it is a good compromise for someone looking for a shoe with a little more comfort and more of a sole to it.
My daughter loves these shoes.  She tried four other pairs before she decided on these.  They are supportive and light and do not rub blisters like the Mizunos.  They also seem to run true to size.
