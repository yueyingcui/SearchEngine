Heelys Chazz (Toddler/Youth/Adult)
My daughter is 9, and she loves her Heeley's! This style is so cute. She didn't want anything bulky, and these were perfect! I went down a size like it suggests, and it worked out great! 
I purchased these for myself...yes I am older than 12! (26 actually.) I thought they would be fun. I wear a size 9 - these are big, nearly a half size too big, but as long as the wheels are in and I am not really walking it's fine. (You have to walk on the balls of your feet so in this case slipping around at the heel in the shoe is minimal.) Only when the wheels are out and I am walking normally does the size issue become apparent with slipping. Happy either way - they are super cute and fun - and I get a fair amount of compliments on the style/color. Still learning to use them though!
My boy lived in Heelys for years before finally outgrowing the largest sizes. Now my daughter is thrilled to have her first pair. The shoes are well built and provide lots of entertainment and exercise. Not to be confused as a regular daily shoe however. For example, the Chazz model looks like a regular tennis shoe, but it's a clever illusion. The inside depth is less than you'd think due to the wheel bed inside.
