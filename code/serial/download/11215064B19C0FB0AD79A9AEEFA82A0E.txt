Dunham Captain
I love 'em. Buy a new pair or more every spring. I find this Dunham's boat shoe far superior to anything Sperry offers. My size is 11 4E.
With size 12A/B feet (i.e. long and skinny) finding comfortable shoes has been a challenge, especially in the casual category.  These Dunhams fit like gloves, right out of the box.  No break in required.  A winner!
I recently received a pair o boat shoes for a Christmas gift however, they were the wrong size. I thought that it was going to be a big hassle to exchange them but to my surprise it was a wonderful experience and I received my replacement within 24 hours. What great service! As to my NB Dunham Captain shoe they fir perfectly and I have a great deal of trouble finding my narrow size. I always purchased Sebago boat shoes but now I have changed brands because of the fit.
For someone that wears a full 3E shoe, I have gotten tired of the 2W substitutes. These fit just as sized; they are comfortable on my foot (albeit a touch wide since I am really a 3E). I wish I could get true 3E boating shoes that I like.
Bought these for my husband and he loves their comfort and fit. No small feat (pun intended) for a size 10 narrow!
Good looking and wearing shoe. Felt true to size and true to width. My size 14B shoes are very comfortable and well made and they fit my narrow foot just right. I would recommend this shoe for casual wear with khakis or jeans.

These shoes are great! Having a  narrow foot it is very frustrating finding stylish casual shoes.  I thought I'd give fhese a try and boy, I'm I glad I did.  These shoes are very comfortable and are true to size.  Will buy them again.
Fantastic boat shoe! I have very wide feet and the 4E fit perfect. I usually wear a size 12 but fit into an 11 1/2. It is my first pair of Dunham and will buy more shoes in the future.
