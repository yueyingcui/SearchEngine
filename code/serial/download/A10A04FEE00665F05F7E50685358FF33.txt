Shimano SH-WR41
I wear a street size 11, occasionally a 10. I ordered the 44 in this shoe, and the toe box is ridiculously large. It is so large you cannot tighten the strap enough to secure your toes in the shoe. Just because my feet are long, does not mean that my toes are ridiculously fat or wide. Also, these blaringly white shoes are pretty ugly. I have also tried a mens Shimano size 43 in another style and they were too small. Offering half sizes and better styles and colors might help. Won't be shopping for Shimanos any longer.
So far, I am happy with these shoes. I usually wear a size 6 but wanted to be sure they weren't too tight like some cycling shoes so I ordered a 38 which is about a 6.5. They are a tiny too big but I think a size down might be too small and they work fine.  The straps are easy to adjust and work smoothly. I cycle (outdoor)  several times a week and they haven't hurt my feet yet. They work well, wish they had a little more play on pulling up part of the pedaling but they work fine. I like how there is plenty of room in the toe area. They are a nice shoe and I'd buy them again. I do wish they had them in black or another color but they do match my white back so I guess it works!
Wow, a perfect fit! These are deep enough at the heel and adjustable with the three straps so that you get a perfect fit. Also, I wear a size 11 (even sometimes a 10) so I was concerned about the size 44 (for 11+) but it was the right choice for sizing. Wow, am I happy!
I was originally looking to purchase the Shimano SH-WR40 but found these, which are the newer version of the WR40. I am so happy I purchased these adverse to the other model. These work perfectly for my road bike and my indoor spin bike. They are 10 stars! I typically wear a size 7.5 - 8.0 and purchased these in a size 40 which is about a 7.8 and the size was perfect.
