Nike Kids Fusion TR 3 (Toddler/Youth)
So great we bought in 2 sizes. My son is in second grade so he doesn't want "velcro" sneakers, but tying is still a problem. These shoes don't look like the traditional velcro sneakers because of the laces. (Which aren't really laces, but elastic.)
These sneakers rock. My 6 year old son loves them. They are light, comfortable, easy to get off/on and seem to be wearing well. They are true to size and noticeably more narrow than the Free Run Nikes he had previously.
