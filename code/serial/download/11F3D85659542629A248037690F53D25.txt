Nike Shox Classic II SI
I love the look of these shoes, but the rim of tongue is lined with wire I guess and it digs into the top of your foot. I wore them to work yesterday and couldn’t wait to take them off. When I got them off my ankles were swollen where the tongue of them had buried in my ankles. DEFINITELY DISSATISFIED!! I have to wear white shoes to work and I even got a size bigger and didn’t tie them tight and it still caused the top of my ankle to be swollen and very sore. I have skinny ankles. So not a good choice!!
Great Looking Shoe! 
I ordered this shoe in the white/silver/pink combo. It really is an awesome looking shoe and I've received plenty of compliments. I ordered half a size up so I could insert arch supports for flat feet. I also ordered these at the same time as the adidas megabounce and ended up keeping both. The adidas are more comfortable but the nike shox really look great are easier to keep clean.
