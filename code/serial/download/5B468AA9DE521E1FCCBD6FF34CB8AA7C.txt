PUMA PowerCat 3.12 TT
Awesome boots for the money. They're very good looking, and they are pretty easy to clean and keep the leather looking good. They're also among the more comfortable boots I've had. Decent arch support in the middle of the foot, solid cushioning, comfortable width. I think soccer boots should fit small, so I recommend ordering at least a half size down to keep you from stubbing your toe when you kick the ball. I know that PUMAs tend to run small, but these don't.
