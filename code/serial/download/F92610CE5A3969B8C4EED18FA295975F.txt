Reebok RealFlex Transition 2.0
Great if you're indoors! Got these a 1/2 size larger as I have semi-wide feet with flat arches and I've worn these before at the store and loved how comfortable they are; however, I live in CO and we do a lot of light trail running. These shoes are not for the outdoors. I constantly got small pebbles and rocks lodged in between the nubs and you can really feel the ground under your feet in these shoes. Concrete running was just fine though. As for my arches, I had to buy inserts to help the lack of any over-pronation support and they made the shoes that much better, but that 1/2 size larger tended to make the ankle portion of the shoe bow out. This is probably a result of the shoe having a ton of flex, which is good, but after a while you notice the gap on your ankle as you jog ahead. I wish I could return them, but that 1 outdoors run chewed up some of the lugs and the white on the bottom gets dirty real quick; that said, for indoor use these shoes are very comfortable.
