SKECHERS Bikers - Proposal
I had to send my usualo size 7 and a 7 1/2 back.  My toes were right up at the top.  They do run wide but that was OK with me.  I ordered an 8 and they were fine.
I have to send these back because they are a little big for me. I bought another pair of Skechers in the same size that fit just fine so I think these run a little big. They're not super comfortable otherwise...a little stiff around the heel. Pretty cute, just don't think I can wear them.
