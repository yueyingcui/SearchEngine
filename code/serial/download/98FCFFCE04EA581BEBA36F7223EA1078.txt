Keen Arroyo II
I have worn Arroyo IIs for years. Keen recently changed the sizing of at least the size 13. They are a lot bigger now than they used to be. My feet swim around inside the shoes now. If you have got the same problem, try the Keen Glissan. These sandals are a little nicer and fit great.
Great pair of all-around shoes! Performed great hiking and even peak climbing in Colorado, walking through streams (waterproof and dried quickly).  Also great around town, and perfect for slipping on quickly like a sandal.  Just an all-around durable, comfortable, high performance shoe. Definitely runs a full size big, and took about 2 days to break in.
