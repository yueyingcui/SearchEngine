New Balance WW545
Very comfortable shoe with decent support.  Wore first time on a four-mile hike and they were perfect.  True to size.
These are great looking; not too over-engineered. I think they would have been comfortable if they fit. On my size 8N, they are at least half a size too short. I might try again with a 8Â½N.
