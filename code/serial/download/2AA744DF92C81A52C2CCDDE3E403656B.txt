Garmont Eclipse III XCRÂ®
Order a whole size bigger for sure, especially if you have a bit of a wider foot or high instep.
Order 1/2 size larger for thin socks--order 1 full size larger if you use the padded arches or wear medium wool socks.  These shoes are cut small.  
Only had them a month but a great shoe. Comfortable with great cushioning, solid sole. Fits to size.
