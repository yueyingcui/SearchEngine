ASICS GEL-QuickwalkÂ®
The shoe is too short for my size 13 feet. A 13 1/2 would be perfect in this, but as with every other shoe on the market, half sizes do not exist for size 12 and larger. (Why?!) Otherwise, I love it, and I've been very happy with other Asics shoes (running styles) I've purchased in the past.
