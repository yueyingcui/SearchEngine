PUMA Tekkies SKA Footbed OC Wn's
These shoes run big and a little narrow. I am usually a 5.5 but I had more than a thumb's width extra length at my big toe while standing in these. The style is nice otherwise - casual with a worn-in look from the fraying on the top edges. Sad to be returning but 5.5 is the smallest size.
