Nurse Mates Dove
Bought a 9, my normal size. Needed a 9 1/2. Easy return. Thank you! Felt a little tight at first, then with wear they felt much better.
Extremely comfy. First time wearing them I had to get used to them but my feet never hurt after working a long shift waitressing. Runs true to size.
They are more expensive, but if you are not sure of your size or if the shoe is what you are looking for, the free shipping and free returns are awesome!
Love these shoes! They are so light and comfortable. I usually wear 7.5 medium size. Ordered 7.5 medium and they fit great.
