PUMA 76 Runner Nylon Wn's
I don't usually write reviews but I had to write one on these. I purchased these and received next day shipping with of course free shipping, which was excellent for me. These sneakers run true to size and are so comfy I didn't want to take them off, they felt like I had slippers on. They weren't too tight & had good arch support since I don't have an arch.
True to size. Super light, and comfortable. I didn't realize the 'puma swoosh' on the side was sparkly. Bright and adorable.
These are really great shoes; I love the retro track shoe aesthetic of them and they are very comfortable. They are not especially supportive so if you're looking for that, I'd add inserts; I put a pair of three quarter length Dr. Scholls-style inserts in, making them a perfect blend of comfort, style, and support. Fits true to size.
