Levi's&#174; Shoes Zip Ex Lo - Canvas
The shoe was pretty uncomfortable to break in, to the point where I had to wear different shoes for a couple of days to let my feet heal. They are just very rigid in the toe and possibly a little on the narrow side, but only in the toe. Now that they've worn in a bit they are comfortable...and some insoles added after-the-fact definitely helped too. The zipper on the side is a little extraneous -- it doesn't actually do anything, it is just for show. I often like stuff like that, but found with these that the zipper flopping around and banging on the side of my foot constantly made me feel like I have an untied shoelace or something is otherwise wrong with it. So eventually I removed part of the zipper with a pair of pliers. Now after breaking them in (and scuffing them up a bit), they look good and feel pretty okay too. They didn't have the color/style I wanted in my size so I got these in the meantime, and despite the difficulty in getting them broken in, I still plan to get the other ones when I can find them in my size.
