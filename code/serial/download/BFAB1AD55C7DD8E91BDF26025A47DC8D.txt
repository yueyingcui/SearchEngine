adidas Outdoor Boat CC Lace
I usually wear size 8 shoes. I tried on this shoe before at an Adidas outlet and I figured out the 7 1/2 fit more snugly. Although the sole is made of a sturdy foam material that is ideal for a lightweight water shoe, it doesn't provide any arch support. These are great for pool parties, boat trips, but I would not expect them to still feel comfortable if worn for extended periods of time. They do, however, provide protection from sharp rocks and things that could injure your foot around the water edges, and they look playful and fun.
Love 'em! Lightweight, with sent of kiwi and tropical fruits. True to size and fit.
These are indeed unisex shoes and should be listed under women's shoes as well. Ordered the 8 & 8.5 but both were still too big. Ordered the 7.5 and it fit my size 9M woman's foot with plenty of room. Can't wait to wear them clamming.
