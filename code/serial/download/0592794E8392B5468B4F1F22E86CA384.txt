I bought these for my man and he really likes them. We originally ordered a size 14(his normal size) but they were too small! Glad they had these in a 15 because he really likes them. He likes them because they don't have a lot a of mesh area that rips when he rides his motorcycle. They are nice quality, suede and leather, but a little stiff and take a few wears to break in, which is normal.I like them because they look cool, compared to some hiking/cross trainer shoes. Overall, we are both happy with the purchase.
