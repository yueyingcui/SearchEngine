PUMA Fast Cat SM Wn's
This shoe is incredibly narrow. I only wear Puma's and I wanted to love this shoe, but even my narrow foot couldn't fit it. I tried going up in size and that still didn't help.
I recommend this site to all friends & relatives, the free next day shipping VIP member. When something doesn't fit right they give me the right size the next day! Very efficient & fast in comparison to other online shopping sites.
