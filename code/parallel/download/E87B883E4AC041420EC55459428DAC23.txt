PUMA Skate Mid
These shoes are very stylish. I like the vibrancy of the colors in the shoe. The size I got is a little big for my foot but I still wear them because they are comfortable. The lip has some sort of defect though that rubs on my top of my foot which kind of sucks. Also, the soles of these shoes are very stiff so dancing to dubstep in them is pretty much out of the question.
Great vivid color.  The size 6.5 for women (5 in men, 37 European) runs really big.  I will have to exchange for something smaller.
