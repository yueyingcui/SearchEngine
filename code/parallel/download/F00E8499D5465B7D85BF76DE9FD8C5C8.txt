Easy Spirit Galaxy
Finally, a shoe that fits! I have a narrow heel with a wide front part of my foot, almost impossible to find shoes that fit. The front is nice and roomy and the heel can be tighten with the extra holes. Shoe fits true to size. I have tried many brands, including New Balance and Saucony and I couldn't find a tennis shoe that gave me enough room starting from the arch forward. Just wish someone out there could make a tennis shoe that isn't white so it would look a little dressier.
These shoes far exceeded my expectations! They felt broken in right out of the box, were light as a feather yet very supportive even during hours of walking around a national park, and they do not look like huge boats even in a size 10!
I usually buy New Balance because they offer wide sizes. I was pleased to find that Easy Spirit also offered wide sizes and in fashionable sneakers.
I'm so crazy about these shoes, I'm ordering another pair so I can move into them after I wear out the first ones! They're light, not bulky as many quality walking shoes are, stylish and flattering even to my size 10.5 feet. Easy Spirit rarely disappoints with their products and these shoes are a winner.
Pretty comfortable, although a little less roomy around the instep than the average size 7, and, in my humble opinion, good-looking. I bought these for the arch support that I need because my spine is goofy (spondylolisthesis). My physical therapist approves.
Once I saw these sneakers, I knew these were the ones I wanted without a doubt. Besides, I'm a true fan of Easy Spirit. The only thing I noticed with this style is that they definitely run at least a half size larger than normal (but not quite a full size). They're extremely comfortable. I may purchase another pair in case ES decides to discontinue this style by the time my new ones wear out.
