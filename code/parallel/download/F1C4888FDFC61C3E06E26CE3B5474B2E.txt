Scarpa Epic
This is my first pair of scarpas, I initially thought I might need a pair a half size larger as these shoes run narrow/ tight yet after only one day they seemed to self adjust perfectly and have become some of the most comfortable shoes I have owned. Born and Blarks included! Also the styling has a perfect balance of subtle/graphic. A+
