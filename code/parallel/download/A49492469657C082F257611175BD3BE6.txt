Keen Brixen Lo
Finally a Keen slip on that fits. This one seems to run a half size big but other than that it's warm, waterproof, and comfortable. I had to send back all other Keens I tried because the sizing was all over the map. Keens quality control seems to be slipping in the last year.
These are very comfortable shoes. I am glad that they are making them again. As a whole I have not been impressed with the new generation of Keen shoes, but these are an exception. About half a size larger than marked, enough for thick socks. They provide great support and plenty of width throughout. So far they are quite durable.
These are great shoes but nearly a full size smaller than stated. Very surprising for Keen.
