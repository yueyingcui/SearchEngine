Superga Kids 2750 JVEL Classic (Toddler/Youth)
So cute and comfortable! They seem to fit true to size and the canvas is holding its color well so far. Even bought the next size up to have for when he grows out of thia pair.
Love these Superga sneakers! They ran huge, had to return and size down but very comfy and real preppy!
