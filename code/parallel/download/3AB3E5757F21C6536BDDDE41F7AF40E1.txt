Polo Ralph Lauren Rylander Canvas/Leather
My feet are slightly wider than normal, so I always buy a shoe that is wider or a half size larger. This shoe was not available in a wider width so I bought a half size larger. I like the shoes and the way they look. They are comfortable enough to wear all day and a good value.
These are great shoes and match with a lot of things; just make sure if you're in my size 8-8 and half get a half size smaller.
