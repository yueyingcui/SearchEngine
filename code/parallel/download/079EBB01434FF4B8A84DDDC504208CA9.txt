inov-8 Roclite™ 286 GORE-TEX®
First off, they were true to size and truly light. I have had them for about three or four weeks and have only about 20 miles on them in about four very short hikes in my local mountains. I am recovering from an ankle injury skiing the end of march 2012 so I am still taking it a bit easy. The cut gives just the minimal added support that i need with a bit of tape. I love the sole and grip action. They are just all around very comfortable. I racked up over 500 miles each on my last two pairs of Inov-8 trail runners before the tread lost the effectiveness. I am totally loyal to this brand. The crazy thing is I participate in several triathlons and these are are almost as lite as my Zoot TT 3.0 running shoes.
I run barefoot in the summer but wanted a shoe that could stand up to a New England winter. This seemed to be it, a low drop shoe that is attractive in design and very very light on the foot. Unfortunately the width is too narrow for my wide-ish foot. I hoped since the sizing is unisex that the width would be more generous as it would need to also potentially accommodate a man's foot, but in fact it is a rather narrow toe box. Disappointed, as this looks and feels like an awesome shoe. I can't go up another size either as the shoe seems to run long, I had already ordered up half a size from my usual, and there was plenty of room to spare at the toe.
A crowning achievement. I can't fully communicate how rad these boots are. Light, waterproof, functional. It’s like wearing nothing at all. Buy a half size up.
