PUMA FAAS 550
This is a good looking shoe that is light and comfortable. True, there isn't that big bump for the arch, but it's enough support for me. I usually wear a 10, but with Nike and New Balance I've always had to get a 10.5. I returned the size 10 for a 10.5 and they fit perfectly.  I even got a black & red pair for my husband who had the same sizing issue. He really likes them as well.
