PF Flyers Center Hi
Great pair of shoes, been wearing Chuck Taylors my entire life, never thought of buying PF Flyers not out of dedication to Converse but I just always stuck with the same old, but as my first pair, I wont go back to Converse. They're just so much more comfortable the sole is removable and soft, but they run true to size, not big like Converse.
Love the shoes - they have a high arch, and they are nice and light.
Keep in mind they are a little longer than other shoe sizes.
