Tsukihoshi Kids Tornado (Toddler/Youth)
I bought these shoes for my daughter, size 4.5 youth, and they were way too big. I could fit in them and I wear a 7.5 in adults. Keep that in mind if ordering these. This is the first time I've purchased this brand so I don't know if all their shoes run big or not.
