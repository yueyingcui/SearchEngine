Ralph Lauren Layette Kids Bal Harbour Repeat Soft Sole (Infant)
Too Cute - 
These shoes are just too cute for words. For my 6 month old daughter, they were too small so I am going to reorder in a size 2. Overall I think the look of the shoe is great, and the color goes with everything. I cannot wait to get the correct pair.
