Sperry Top-Sider Tasselfish 
Stylish with a very neutral look. So comfortable, I'll be wearing these instead of sneakers for a less sloppy look. Be sure to order one half size smaller than you usually order.
I bought an older version of these last year and I love them! They were a little tight to start with but as soon as I started wearing them they stretched and I love them. The shoes are so comfortable and I would love to buy another pair, but I can't find them in my size again! I wear a size 10 and they are true to size. 
I love the color and style of this shoe but it will be more comfortable on a narrow foot.  My foot is a medium (average) width and I could tell that if I was sightseeing all day, my feet would hurt at the end of it.  If I wasn't planning on using these shoes for traveling, I'd probably have kept them because I can put up with a little discomfort if I am not walking that much.  I'm a big fan of Sperry's and have been wearing a half-size too small for years because the pair I fell in love with wasn't available in my size (at the time).  They make the coolest boat shoes.
Love the tasselfish Sperry--very comfortable, great cushioning, true to size. More colors please!
Like the shoe, but too big. I have a similar style (same sole type) that I bought in a 1/2 size smaller than my usual. This one is consistent with that. And unfortunately they do not come in a 5 1/2.
