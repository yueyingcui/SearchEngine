PUMA El Ace Ballet Wn's
I purchased the El Ace in the green color. These shoes fit true to size and are very comfortable! The laces can be tied and add a nice look. I usually don't wear bright colored shoes but these are too cute and stylish. Love them!
These are some very comfortable shoes. I normally wear a 7 1/2, but that size was too big so I bought this in a 7 and it worked wonderfully.
