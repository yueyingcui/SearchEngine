New Balance WO900
These shoes were narrow on my feet, so I took them to a shoemaker to have them stretched. They are better, but bother the top part of my foot after wearing for several hours. I do have difficult to fit feet, and wish I had kept the box and returned them from the start. I have other NB shoes in the same size that are very comfortable.
I liked these shoes from the moment I slid my feet into them. I tried on 9 pairs prior to these. the support is good and the length and width are true to size. I have not worn them hiking yet and hope they wear well, but they are comfortable.
