Five Ten Hellcat
These shoes are really comfy. They are big and I notice that they hit the ground when I corner hard (I've got big feet - size 14). Walking around in the shoe is a pleasure and it's easy to forget that they cycling shoes. You will need to grease your cleat for the first ride or else you will have a problem releasing. This problem will stop once the shoe gets worn down on the SPD cutouts.
These shoes run almost an entire size larger.  I own multiple Five Ten shoes and had to order these several times to get the right fit. 
For downhill mtn biking/racing. These shoes are very heavy and heavy duty. If you want a light spd shoe for X-Country these aren't it. These are for aggressive downhill riding/racing with spd's. If you want to use these as flats the Sam Hill-type models are better. With that said I own multiple pairs of Five Tens and they're great! Also, I read a review where someone said they run small. No, they run big -- especially wide. I normally wear 11 to 11 1/2 in bike shoes and I had to drop a half size and almost wish I had dropped a full size. You don't want spd shoes to be loose or you're going to be slipping when you pedal and getting blisters.
