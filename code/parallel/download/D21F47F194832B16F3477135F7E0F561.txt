Timberland EarthkeepersÂ® Kia Wah Bay 2-Eye Boat
These shoes look great and I highly recommend them. However: they are oversized. I normally wear a size 11 but, after reading the reviews for this shoe, I decided to play it safe and order a 10.5. I ended up having to exchange them for a size 10.
I normally wear a size 10 but based on the reviews, I got a size 9.5 and it fits great, with or without socks.  The shoes look great and they broke in after a couple hours of wear.
Timberland, though a great shoe, seems to run at least a half size larger than others.
Awesome shoe, I wear it every day. Looks the same, hasn't changed one bit. However, the size runs larger than I expected. So get a size lower.
I typically wear a 9.5, but had to return it for a size 9; however, the shoe is really comfortable and looks great for many different occasions, but like other leather shoes it lacks in breathability. I bought an additional pair for when these wear out.
Shoes were horribly mis-sized.  Daily I wear 10.5, and for winter I wear a 11 due to heavier socks.  I bought the Timberlands in a 10.5, and they were so over-sized that even with a medium weight sock, I can easily fit my index finger into the heel of the shoe.   This is my second mis-sized pair of shoes in a row, and I have to wonder if it's due to Chinese manufacturing.
These are awesome top siders. It is great to get the look, quality and fit in this larger size.
Great looking shoes. The EE width fit perfect for my wide feet. They're sized right, don't run big or small. I'm typically wary of the boat shoe look but these look fantastic. Very comfortable as well.
Nice shoe, I'm usually 11-11.5 wide. I got 11.5 wide, wish I got 11. I would suggest going towards smaller side of your size.
