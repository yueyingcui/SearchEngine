SIDI T2 CB Women's
I normally ride in the Sidi road shoes, size 40.5. I ordered these in the same size thinking I'd get pretty much the same shoe but easier to get on and off, which is the whole point of a tri shoe. The length is the same as the road shoe but these feel wider. Also, where the top strap near the ankle is - it comes too close to the leg so with each pedal stroke they rub. Really annoying.
The insole that comes with the shoes is terrible but I use the yellow superfeet insole anyway.
These are alright, but they aren't the same as the road shoe with easier transitions.
