Sperry Top-Sider A/O 2 Eye Canvas 
Extremely comfortable and stylish. Have had several positive comments since I began wearing them. Great shoe. The only negative is there is not a great deal of support, so probably not best for wearing for long periods or if you have to be on your feet all day. More casual, but the style is casual. If you need support consider a 1/2 size larger with an insert.
