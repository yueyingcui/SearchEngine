Brooks Mach 14 Spikeless
I am not a serious runner, but I try to run pretty frequently. I have had the same pair of shoes since I started running and have heard good things about Brooks. I ordered these because the price was great, the style was fun, and they are lightweight. They are very lightweight! I loved them. It felt like I was not wearing shoes. And the sole is strong enough that I did not feel all the debris on the trail from last night's storm. I had no idea how the weight of your shoes affects your running endurance. I logged about three miles this morning. That was the first that I ran in these shoes. My legs did not hurt at all, my feet felt great. Overall, it was a great run and even when it was over, I felt like I could have kept going. I really like these shoes a lot, and for the price, you cannot go wrong. I highly recommend them. I wear 9Â½ in Asics, I needed a 10 in these shoes. I suggest getting half a size larger.
