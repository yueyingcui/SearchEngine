PUMA Fast Cat - Leather
True to size (I wear a 8 1/2 or 9) ordered a 9. Very comfy. Nice dark brown color. Glad I purchased.
Amazing how. As others have pointed out, you should order half a size up than with other Puma shoes. The shoe is very comfortable. I wish Puma had more shoes with thin soles since they don't hurt your knees. Overall, a great purchase and I highly recommend getting these shoes.
