New Balance WW695
Loved the shoes, the color, the weight, but had to return because I need a larger size since I broke my foot.
I love these shoes! They are great walking shoes. I bought them because of their "low key" color scheme and because they are New Balance. They run true to size!
Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn! It is a little difficult to get on because of the stationary tongue, but not a big deal. Also runs a little short - I ordered a half-size up and could have gone a full size for use with thicker socks. But still love!
I bought this shoe in the same size/medium width that I have bought all of my New Balance athletic shoes in but I could barely fit into the shoe barefoot - no way would I manage to get into it with socks, however thin these might be. It was mostly an instep problem but my feet also felt squeezed width-wise. I can tell they are comfortable per se but the left shoe rubbed a bit on my Achilles tendon so regrettably I will have to return these. Too bad because they look really cute and the color is fun as well.
