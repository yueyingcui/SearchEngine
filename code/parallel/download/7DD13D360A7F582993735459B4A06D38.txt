Tsukihoshi Kids Fuji (Toddler/Youth)
These shoes are amazing! My four-year-old has had them for about 4 months, and they still look brand new. They are incredibly flexible, and easy for him to put on by himself. They do run a little large, so order half a size down as recommended. Also, it says they run a little wider than normal, but my son does not have wide feet and they fit him fine, so don't be deterred if you're looking for normal-width shoes.
