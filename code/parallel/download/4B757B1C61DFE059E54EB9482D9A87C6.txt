UGG Vanowen
Great shoes, great style. The sizing is a little tough since there are no 1/2 sizes. I usually wear a 9 1/2 so I went with the 9 and it works, but shading towards the short small side, the 10 was too large for me.
Great sneaker. Has a casual feel to them, so they are very versatile. They run half a size big. I normally wear an 11.5, but found that the 11 fit me better.
Very comfortable and I like the look. I went with a half size smaller as recommended by another buyer and it fits well. Lambs wool padding on right heel wore off quickly.
I bought the shoes because they looked very cool, but they are also very comfortable.  Feels like I am walking on a cloud.  I usually buy size 13 shoes, but had to go with 12 on this one because they run a little big.
I bought the black ones, white ones, and the "beat up" brown ones (crouton leather). The very first ones I bought were the black ones, very comfortable. Then I got the brown ones, just comfortable. Last were the white ones, very uncomfortable. The black leather is easily breakable, avoid the white Vanowens, very stiff even after long use. Also, order one size less than what you normally get. They run big.
Great shoe! I normally wear size 12.5 to 13, so I went with a 13. It was way too big. The 12 is perfect. The footbed is super soft. I love the padding on the heel to prevent blisters. What a great feature!
