Vans LPE
Love the shoe. It has a little more padding around the ankle than the normal Vans Pro style. The shoe is a bit bigger than normal when I bought the same size as always, but I enjoy this because usually I have a week of uncomfortable "breaking in" of the vans I purchase. As someone who buys Vans all the time, these have been one of my favorites. 
These shoes are beautiful. But they run big. I wear a 10½ in Eras, and most shoes. First I ordered a pair in 10½, and they were too big. Then I ordered a pair in 10, and they were still are too big. The worst of all is that I got them during vacation in the US, and the timing did not let me order the right size. So now I have to buy them and send them to my country in South America (which makes it more expensive). I am hoping 9½ will fit me nice and snug. Try going half a size down at least.
Shoe looks good, but is too large (at least 1/2 size larger than marked), and not unique enough to exchange for different size.
