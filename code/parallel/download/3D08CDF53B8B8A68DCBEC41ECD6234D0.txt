New Balance MT110
The shoes are great.  They did feel a half size too large, but other than that, excellent.
Good shoe. They fit true to size on my foot. They do seem to run a little smaller than the minimus. I wear a 12.5 in those and in these a 13 felt better, but I like to run in a shoe that is a little lose. I like the addition of the rock guard in the fore foot, nice to have a little more protection on rocky trails. Still a very light and flat shoe. Have had for 2 weeks and have put around 100 miles on them and don't have any complaints with materials, construction, durability or fit.
Great for crossfit.  I have a very wide foot, which is why I usually go with NB.  Although this shoe is not offered in 4E (which I prefer) I bought the 2E and one 1/2 size higher, and it has worked out very well.  I would love it if NB would expand their offering regarding width sizes, but in the meantime this is a very good choice.  
I really like the lightness and durability of the NB MT110. I wear them all over from the gym to out in the yard. Very versatile and fits very true to size.
