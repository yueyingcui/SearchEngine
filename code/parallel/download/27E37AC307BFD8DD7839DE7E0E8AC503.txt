adidas F10 TRX TF
True to size...I normally wear 11s, and I ordered 11.5 and they feel great! I need a little extra space, and that's why I got them a bit bigger. Either way, these shoes are excellent. They feel good when springing into a sprint, dribbling, and I like the way it feels when I take a shot. Yes, very much like them.
I love the shoes. I slip sometimes but they are extremely light and they are right to the size.
