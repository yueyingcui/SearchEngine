Easy Spirit Trainfree
Amazing shoe! I'm a travel writer and love wearing Easy Spirit walking shoes; I go through 1 or 2 pairs each year. This is lightweight, comfortable, and looks great. And, from what I could tell, it's priced less than similar ones offered on the Easy Spirit website (my size was available there). And free shipping!
I have bad feet, plus very frequent attacks of gout, so foot comfort is my primary need in footwear. When I found this Easy Spirit style, similar to a previous one I had worn for years, which was hard to find in my size, I tried it and found it just as comfortable as I had hoped.
