Rocket Dog Stoker
I love the Rocket Dog Stoker. It is a very comfortable shoe, sporty looking, and true to size. You could wear these shoes walking, shopping or anywhere. They're super comfy and versatile. I love these Rocket Dogs!!

I love my Rocket Dog shoes. They were a half size too small, so returned them for a 7.5. I've never worn a 7.5 before, so they definitely run a half size small. They are super comfortable and I love to wear them to work where I'm on my feet all day. I noticed a bit of the glue under one of the stripes come out right after I got them (more than a month ago). I pulled it out and never had any other problems with them. The square toe is dramatic. I was worried they'd be too clowny. In the black they're fun and spunky and not too silly.
Best shoes EVER. I always buy a few pair when my size comes back into stock - please please please never stop making these! 
They are great for a job that has me on my feet for 8+ hours, inside and out. They look great! 
The only complaint is that the rubber bottoms give out after a few months, but I'm not sure if it's because the sole is weak or that I put these shoes through a lot. 
LOVE THEM. Wide toe bed, cute look, comfy support!

I love the shoes, and actually have a previous pair. Didn't seem real true to size, but they will work. Love the simplicity of ordering and the quick delivery time.
