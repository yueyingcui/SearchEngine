Stride Rite SRT Ellete (Infant/Toddler)
I got these shoes in the black/orange, they were one my son's first shoes when he first started walking. They're super adorable and so grown up looking! They don't seem to hinder his walking, the sole is flexible and the shoe is generally easy to put on. They must be comfortable because my son will come to me when it's time to put on his shoes and never complains once they're on. He doesn't have extremely wide feet, but we got it in a 4.5W and compared to another Stride Rite shoe in the same size, this one is a tad more narrow. But I love this shoe and looking to get it in a different color in a 5W. Based on the fit of this shoe, I would recommend getting at least a wide if your kid's foot isn't super slender. Very good quality. Expensive for a kid's shoe (as compared to the cheapy kind you can get at a discount store), but you get what you pay for!
My son measured XW in our local Stride Rite store. I had ordered a different style which was way too wide, but this was true to size and the XW fit perfectly. 

I purchased these shoes for my son during the summer months for easy on/off. Although I'm not usually a white gym shoe kind of person, the lime green and navy mix it up and they pretty much go with anything he wears during this time of year, including his swimsuit! We also had them in the blue when he was just learning to walk and I can see the difference in the size of the sole from the trainer to the walker, which is great. Both pairs have and continue to wash and dry great and w/out shrinking. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
Nice shoes but I wish I ordered a size bigger. My son was out growing his size 5 shoes and I went with a 5.5 for this purchase. While they fit, I doubt it will be for long. I'm sorry I threw out the box or I would have returned for a size 6.
