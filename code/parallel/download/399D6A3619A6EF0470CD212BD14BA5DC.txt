ASICS Gel-DomainÂ® 2
These were much tighter and narrower than any other Asics I've tried. They are also very stiff. The red is really cute but they just didn't fit and had to go back. I'd recommend trying a half size up from your normal Asic size.
This shoe was purchased specifically for gym classes that require a lot of lateral movement (i.e., step and kick boxing) because my ASICS running shoes did not provide enough ankle/heel support as they are designed to move in a straight line, not side-to-side. Of course you give up some of the cushion of running shoes, but it's worth it to avoid sore ankles, knees and heels. I also had to go down to a 9 from my normal 9.5 ASICS running shoe size, but they run much narrower, especially in the toe box area, than a running shoe.
