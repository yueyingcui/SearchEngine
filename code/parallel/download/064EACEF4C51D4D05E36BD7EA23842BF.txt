Nike Kids Cortez Leather (Youth)
Great shoe! Bought it for my nephew. Compared to other shoes, they seem somewhat smaller for the size, especially since my nephew has narrow feet. So I would recommend buying at least a half size larger. Other than that, these shoes are great, they are comfortable and well made. My nephew has received many compliments for these cool sneakers! The reason I bought it is that they remind the Nike Cortez that were in fashion the early 80s.
I highly recommend buying them!
Shoes are great; however, they do run approximately one size smaller than normal.
Wonderful service. Best shoes I've purchased for my grandsons. Shoes were about a size smaller than I expected, but we were in luck they fit my younger grandson. I just ordered another pair for my 9 year old grandson and they came in before Christmas. Wonderful.
