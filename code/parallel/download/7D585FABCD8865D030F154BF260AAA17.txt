Hello my Name is Keith and I currently own this shoe in the Grey/Orange/Black and it kicks ass. I ordered a pair from another site in size 13. I thought size 13 was fine but there a size too big. I always wear a size 13 or 14 and these are unusual shoes so I should be wearing a 12 in these! Anyway amazing shoes, well worth the money I highly recommend. Also you can get different colors at journeys.com. Thanks for reading.
It’s a good shoe!!!!!!!
It’s a good shoe for casual and skating...But they need to make them in size twelve so I can start skating again cuz it’s the only shoe I like to skate in cuz its so damn comfortable.

Great Shoe!!
Great shoe. Very Comfortable and looks really good as well. The only two problems that I have with the shoe is that it is about a half size smaller than what I normally wear, and there is a seam in the toe that for the first two weeks of wear was kinda uncomfortable.

Shoetacular!
I love these shoes! I had the older version of the shoe and it was a full size smaller than this pair. They are both size 7, yet the older pair are super tight and the newer pair fit well.
So I had to return the shoe and get the size 7. Don't assume you know what size to get.
