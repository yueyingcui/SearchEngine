Nike Action Renzo 2
These shoes look great. Gotten lots of compliments on them. If you get the Wolf/Dark Grey ones: the laces and the area around them is not black, it's dark grey. In my opinion this looks better, but it was unexpected. When I first tried them on, my heel was flying out of the shoe. I solved this problem by lacing them up to the extra hole (the one not used in the picture). I would recommend not getting this shoe a size too big for your feet, because when pulled very tight the tongue becomes quite unsightly.
