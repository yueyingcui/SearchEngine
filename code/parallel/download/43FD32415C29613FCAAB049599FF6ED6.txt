New Balance MR1400
Shoes are good, very light and easy to run in once you break them in a bit. I love the colors and how easy they make running on changing surfaces (I run in NYC). Only bad thing is that sizes run pretty small. Get at least a half size bigger, especially if you're running long distance in these.
These are great shoes. Very light, great for packing!
They run small so order at least a half size larger than normal.
