Sperry Top-Sider CVO
These are great shoes! The print is super fun and goes with almost anything. They are very comfortable and cute, which is why I got them. I needed something to wear on vacation that involved lots of walking. The arch support is good! I have a very high arch, but they are still supportive. However if you want the same tennis show style with higher arch support, get the Ugg sneakers. I have those too and they are probably the most supportive shoes I own. The style of the Sperry is very flattering - they make my feet look smaller and narrower. They are true to size. I usually wear a 9, got a 9, and they still allow room for thin ankle socks which is perfect.
These are a great everyday pair of shoes. I ordered my normal size 8 and was a little worried that they wouldn't fit because they felt stiff. However, after wearing them around, I've broken them in and they feel great. There's some arch support in these shoes which is really great. Again, these are a great pair of classic summer shoes.
Love the print of this shoe! Perfect for summer. I wear between a 7.5 and 8 in shoes but this one (and all other Sperry shoes I have) I wear a size 8.
Love the shoes & the service. Read a review saying the shoes ran a little small, so I ordered a half size bigger. Perfect fit!
