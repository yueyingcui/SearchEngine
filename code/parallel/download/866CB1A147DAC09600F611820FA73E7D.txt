Five Ten Karver
Stealth soles rule! Definitely improve pedal contact and the great ankle padding keeps me solid on the hike-a-bike portages. I had to buy a 1/2 size up for a comfortable fit. The elastic hook and loop closure is not secure and is a disappointing design. The snug fitting shoe is a bonus on the dirt but a struggle to slip on and off. Not the best looking style, but who cares and get out there and get 'em dirty!
I highly recommend the women's Karver for mountain biking, whether it's DH or hitting up your local single track. I'm not a clip-in rider, I ride flat pedals on my full suspension bike, and the Karvers are the deal, that stealth rubber sole does the job! No slippage, even when going through snow, streams, and rocky trails. I have to say when I place my foot on the pedal it feels "locked in" with the Karver sole. Also good with repelling H20. I, too, went with others suggestions on going a 1/2 size smaller and so did my hubby with the men's Karver.
