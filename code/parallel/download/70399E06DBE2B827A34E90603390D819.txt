inov-8 Roclite 335 GORE-TEXÂ®
Nice light boot, but despite what others said about these being wide and large, I could barely gt my foot in my normal size with a light sock.
Saw these boots on the Today Show; I needed boots for hiking that would also be good for casual wear. Boots look great, very comfortable from the first wearing. Lots of room for thicker socks in winter. Shoe size - usually wear 8 1/2 or 9 - ordered 8 1/2 - fit is great.
These boots are great looking, so much so that I wanted to keep them very badly. They have great toe room and good cushioning. The lace and grommet area are stiff to deal with. I would have worked to break them in but each time I took them off my socks were slightly sweaty...the socks are smart wool blend socks and usually don't sweat. I was very disappointed as I felt I would have worn them all the time. They are going back. I ordered a 1/2 size up like always and the fit was good with thick socks.
I was waiting to see some reviews before buying this boot, but I couldn't wait any longer! I wear a 7.5 in the F-Lite 230s and got a 7.5 in this boot. It is surprisingly roomy, but I plan to wear these with super thick socks this winter so I'll stick with this size. They are even cuter in person with the green and raspberry colors and feel weightless on my feet. I like that this is a mid height boot, but there is a spot where the tongue fabric overlaps with the shoes fabric and it rubs my foot awkwardly. However, I have worn them for several hikes and don't seem to notice the rubbing once I'm hiking. No break in period, overall super comfy. Recommend!
