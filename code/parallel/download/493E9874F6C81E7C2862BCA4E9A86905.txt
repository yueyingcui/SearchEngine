Nike Initiator
Very nice shoe for the price, great for work or play! I would suggest getting a half size larger then you would normally wear for best fit, I took the advice from someone else and it worked for me!
I am very pleased with these shoes. They felt good from the moment I put them on. I did need to get them a 1/2 size bigger than I normally wear though so you may want to do that too.
I think they run 1/2 size big. I have a narrow feet and they feel too wide, but the shoe is beautiful!
