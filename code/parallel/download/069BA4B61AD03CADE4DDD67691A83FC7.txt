Sanuk Standard Poncho
A beautifully colored casual shoe which is true to size. At first they seemed a little tight but since they are handmade, the fabric has a little give and hugs the foot. I won't be wearing socks with these yet still have enough wiggle room for my toes to wear with or without socks.
