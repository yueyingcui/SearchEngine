GoLite Lime Lite
Very comfortable shoes! The cleats and thicker sole really seem to absorb the shock of each step. They fit true to size. Really liked the option of adding in the extra insole component as my feet are narrow and it's really hard to find shoes that fit well. I work retail, so a nice shoe like this is a necessity!
Beware and runs 1/2 size small. Also, the shoe may have zero drop but the insole does add height to the heel, especially with the wide insole.
I love the look of this shoe. Even on my size 11 feet it looked small. Unfortunately, I didn't like the fit. I found it to be a tad on the small side lengthwise. I could not stand the vinyl insole. I found it to provide little support and it was slippery and very hot. After trying them around the house for a minimal time period, I had blisters starting on both heels. This shoe has a lot of potential, but it is not the shoe for me.
Great shoe so far! Very comfortable heel fit (I have a bit of a narrow heel, size 11), enough room in toe box. However, stepped on a wet wood deck and slipped (almost fell, wrenched my appendix). Wait, I don't have an appendix. I'd be careful on wet, flat surfaces.
I purchased these shoes for an upcoming trip to France (lots of walking in the cold). I began breaking them in today. 
They are comfortable and sturdy and do not make my 8 1/2 size feet look big (actually small and cute). I ordered 8 1/2, they fit great and I am wearing thick socks. Thin socks fit great, too. 
I have an issue with the shoes I frequently have on Keen shoes among others (and believe it's not an issue with the shoe as much as my foot)..a part digs into my Achilles's tendon. A few band-aids or some moleskin in the heel of the shoe fixes this. 
I have not yet played with the varied insoles. I have a wide ball of the foot and high arches. My arches are supported and my ball of foot area is not too snug/cramped.
