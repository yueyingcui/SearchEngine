SKECHERS Bikers - Verified
This is my 3rd pair. And if they come out with another color besides what they already have, I'll purchase them. Love them! They slip on and feel as though they were hand made just for me. So comfortable. Usually with Skechers I have to go 1/2 a size up, but not with the Bikers Verified. Perfect fit, lots of toe room. Can't say enough good about these shoes! Did I mention...love them?
