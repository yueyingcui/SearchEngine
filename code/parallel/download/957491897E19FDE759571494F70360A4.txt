Tsukihoshi Kids Mirage (Toddler/Youth)
This is my third pair of these shoes for my son. This brand runs big so order at least a half size down. The major advantage to these shoes is that they are super lightweight. Compared to other sneakers we've tried these seem to be half the weight, which has to be more comfortable for my little guy. The hold up really well, and although they are washable, I don't think I've ever needed to wash them (at least not yet). They are not cheap, but well worth the money, based on their quality, comfort and durability. Highly recommended. Also: easy on and off, big advantage when you want to avoid the frustration melt-down. May your little one wear them in good health.
Great tennis shoes!
What a great pair of starter tennis shoes! These are lightweight and great for my 3 yr old. He can put them on and take them off by himself and they are stylish! Seems like this brand used to run a half size larger than normal, but they seem to be right on track now.
Comfortable for my 4yo - 
Like these shoes- my son says they are "fast". They've gotten pretty banged up pretty quickly though- more quickly than the blue and white ones we had in a size smaller from the same brand- which we loved.

Shoes - 
My son has irregularly wide feet especially at the toe area due to his syndrome. The shape really worked for him. I didn’t think they were wide enough since he wears a double wide usually but the shoe seems to form to the foot because of the stretchy material and he always wants to wear them so they must be comfortable. He is very wide on the top as well so the tongue doesn’t quite cover the top of his foot, but they still look ok...I don’t think he will be in them very long though a double wide size would have been perfect but it is working. We really like the shoe though.
