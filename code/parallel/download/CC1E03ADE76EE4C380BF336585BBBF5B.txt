Vivobarefoot Neo Trail L
This is a very comfortable and well made barefoot style shoe. It does seem to run a bit small - I had to return a pair and order the next larger half size.
I am a lady with skinny size 9 women feet (I usually wear medium shoes though). I bought those shoes in 9.5 because other reviews said they ran small. Well, they are too long and too wide. So I gave them to my husband who wears size 9.5 men and he has wide feet. They fit perfectly. He is planning on running with them.
I like these shoes but I just wanted to say that they do run small! I had to get a full size larger and I think I maybe should have even gone two sizes larger.
