adidas Golf Tech Response 4.0
Very comfortable golf shoe. I read a review that suggested ordering a half size larger than usual and glad I did. They fit perfectly. Excellent value.
I started golfing just over a year ago. These are my first pair of golf shoes. The soft spikes have provided a much stronger base to work with. I play in North Texas on courses with somewhat hard, sandy soil, and it's a huge improvement over running shoes. Great look, function and feel, especially at this price. Good for average to slightly narrow foot. True to size vs my running shoe size.
A very comfortable golf shoe.  Light in weight and reminsent of an athletic shoe.  Good grip on the soles.  Fits true to size.  I would highly reccomend this shoe.
The shoe is narrow, which I like. It is a bit short, order half-size longer than normal.
