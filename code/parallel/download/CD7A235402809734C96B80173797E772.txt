Saucony Progrid Xodus 3.0
Love, love this shoe its perfect for my needs light weight, breaths, fits like a glove. Traction is great for getting up those steep hills. Buy a full size larger should be perfect.
I love these shoes! The first time I wore them I went for a short 2.5 mile trail run to see how they'd do. They were great, my feet felt good and my gait seemed more springy. I wear a size 6 and have squarish toes and a narrower heel. Shoes often slip off my heels or pinch my toes.
I have been wearing Saucony shoes for about 20 years. I am an ex-collegiate athlete and a big fan. For some reason, these shoes feel very binding. I went up half a size but then they felt too big. I have never had trouble with Saucony. Maybe it is just me. They are cool shoes. I wish they were more comfortable. I am going with a different style. Best of luck!
I had such high hopes for these shoes. Finally no girly plum/white/aqua/pink colors and they came in the size that I would usually order from Saucony - an 11½ (too bad there was no narrow option). They are so disappointing. The 11½ was too small. I could feel my toes touch the end of the shoe once I put my extra insoles in to take up width. I returned them to try the 12 and they were way too long. Also the tongue was so skinny it pulled out of the laces and the pocket for the laces was oddly long and bulky.
