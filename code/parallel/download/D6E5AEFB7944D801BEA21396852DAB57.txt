PUMA Speeder Mesh II Wn's
Comfortable and fit well with an urban look. I sized up on suggestion of a previous viewer and this turned out well. The sneaker runs small, so I sized up from my usual size 9 to 9.5 and that worked perfectly. The soles are great for walking around the city, though, if you're doing a lot of walking, for hours on end, you might want something with a little more cushioning. But for running errands, these will work excellently. 
I love these Pumas. They are cushioned and comfy. I work at an animal hospital and these shoes give me the comfort to be on my feet all day with the traction I need when rushing around the clinic taking care of pets. I ordered a 9.5, when I am usually closer to an 8.5/9. Pumas sometimes run a little narrow. I have a little bit of extra toe room in these because I ordered a half size up, but the width is perfect. I have been a long fan of Pumas for their durability and comfort. They are fashionable and comfortable. I wear them more of work than for working out - preferring my barefoot style Merrells for workouts. These shoes are for comfort on those 14 hour days at the clinic.
