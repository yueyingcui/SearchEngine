UGG Roxford TF
I have size 14 feet, but wear orthotics, so sometimes I need to go up to size 15. I got these in a 14, and with my orthorics, they are a little tight to get my foot in, but not while I'm wearing them.

Overall the shoes are fine, nothing special, but pretty comfortable. My only big complaint is that the fur pulls down any old socks you are wearing for the first couple days until you mat it down. Hopefully they are cool in the Summer.
