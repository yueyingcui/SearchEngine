New Balance W990
I wear these shoes 8-11 hours a day, on my feet all day, working in the operating room.  They were (and are) comfortable , right out of the box, fit true to size, do not need to be broken in.  I am very happy with them!
These shoes fit me well. I wore my old 992s long past their useful life because the 993 did not fit me at all. They were too narrow in the toe no matter what combination of sizes I tried. These 990s fit well; unlike the first reviewer, I find the toe box perfect. I have a foot with wide toes (my little toe is right up near the others), but a narrow midfoot and narrow heel. I did have to go up to a half size longer than my 992s, but I do not know if that is New Balance sizing or my feet growing. My one complaint about the shoes is that the red color on the "New Balance" name on the end of the tongue rubs off on the laces. I was tempted to give them four stars for style because of that feature, but I do like the style otherwise. Just lose the unnecessary red dye. And thanks, New Balance, for bringing back a slightly wider pair of shoes, which I can wear!
