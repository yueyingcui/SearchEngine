New Balance MW606
Great looking and fitting shoe.  Plenty of room for my very wide and flat size 15 feet. I just wish they came in more colors.
 True to size. Very well made shoe.
Never disappointed with New Balance.
Delivered right on time. 
Finally I found a shoe that feels comfortable because of the unique lacing. I hope they continue this show because it has been out of stock in my size for several months.
Seems to be labeled a half size smaller than other shoes - I had to get a half size larger than I normally get for the length to work for me. Shoe is instantly comfortable and is good for "off-road" traction as the sole seems to wrap around uneven terrain (rocks, etc.) better than other shoes. The shoe grips dirt surfaces very well. However, this shoe is darn slippery on wet pavement. Will probably get arch support insert later. I would buy this shoe again.
