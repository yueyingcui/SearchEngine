New Balance Kids KJ553 (Toddler/Youth)
While very lightweight and breathable, beware the entire toe at the top and sides is MESH, rain goes right through. True to size, though.
Purchased these for my 7 year old that likes to run 5ks. Bought a size larger than he was measured and had to send them back because they were huge. Requested the measured size and he has plenty of room at the toe. NB fan!
I have a 5 year old with very wide feet; really hard to find comfortable shoes for him. These in the wide size were perfect.
Great running and all-around shoe. This is my son's second pair and he wears them to school every day so he can run fast at recess. They hold up pretty well given that he wears them every day. Will order the next size up when the time comes.
Ordered these for my son because the local New Balance store had no selection for his size whatsoever!
The fit is perfect and the cost was reasonable compared to the store.
Got these for my 8 year old and he loves them. I've always had a hard time buying shoes for him. He has a flat foot and it's hard to find shoes he'll even wear. These are comfortable and because of the mesh lining. His feet don't sweat. True to size and looks great with shorts and jeans. Great shoes.
I ordered these shoes (size 1) for my 5 year old daughter. I'd gotten tired of buying cheap, big box store shoes that fall apart after a few months of wear. We are very happy with the shoes. My daughter loves how they look, which we all know is what matters for little girls. From my perspective, they are a much better value than many (most?) shoes out there. The first day she wore them, they rubbed around her ankles. I may have tied them too tight, but there was a short break-in period. Since then, though, no complaints. And, this is the first pair of tie shoes she's had that actually stay tied! Big plus!
