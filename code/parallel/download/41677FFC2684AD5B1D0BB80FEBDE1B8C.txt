Nike Air Flight Falcon
They look very nice but run a little big. I bought a 7½ and they were too small so I got an 8½ and they were too big but when I went to order an 8 they were out of stock. Overall the shoes look great and the service is amazing but the sizes are disappointing.
My son is in love with these shoes. I can't blame him. Fit true to size. You will not be disappointed.
