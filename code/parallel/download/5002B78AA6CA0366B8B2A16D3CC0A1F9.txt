Brooks Kids Girls Ghost (Youth)
I ordered a 1Â½ and they were too small for my daughter who is wearing a 1.0. Also, these definitely have a running shoe profile (higher, cushioned heel) which may not be perfect as her gym shoe since she has rolled her ankles a couple times recently so rather than reordering a larger size I am going to look for a lower sole/court shoe. The colors are cool though.
