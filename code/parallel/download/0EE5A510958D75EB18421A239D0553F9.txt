Patagonia Tsali 2.0
This shoe is amazing. Lightweight, yet very supportive. Patagonia has hit a home run! I use it for working out, light hiking and casual wear. I have a narrow heel and have a hard time finding shoes to fit - these hug the heel as well as the rest of the foot. Plenty of room in the toe box and the fit is very adjustable with the lacing system. I prefer mine snug, but not too tight. I find the size in length and width to be true. Given the quality materials and construction, they should last awhile too.
Love these shoes.  I wear a size 9.5 so I am always looking for shoes that offer good support without being bulky.  These could have a touch more arch support but overall I am pleased with the comfort level.  I also really like the grey color.
