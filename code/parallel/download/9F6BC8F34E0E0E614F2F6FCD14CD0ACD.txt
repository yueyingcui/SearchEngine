Timberland PRO TiTANÂ® Oxford Soft Toe
I really enjoy these shoes. They are very comfortable although I had to get a 1/2 size smaller (10.5) than I normally wear in other shoes. I was looking for a shoe that had a rugged, durable look like a boot and this one fits the bill! I wear it with casual pants (jeans, corduroy, khakis).
Very good quality shoe. Wanted a work shoe, non-steel toe and this one fits the bill. It is a little larger than true size but not too much. They will easily fit two socks or extra warm woolies when it is cold weather. Would buy again.
