Fallen Forte
I bought these for my 14 year old son. He loves them and is especially glad to find them in his size 14. Well made and he says they are comfortable for skate shoes.
The Forte looks great and is extremely comfortable right out of the box. For skateboarding they are ready to ride as soon as you get them. However, they do not hold up well at all. Mine have been skated lightly over the last two months and they are done for now. This is not the best purchase for skating, but for daily wear they would be a great buy. Many people feel shoes are smaller than marked, but they might want to figure out what their real size is.
Great pair of shoes! They fit true to size and are a good price.  It is easy to find other brands in local stores, but Fallen skate shoes are sometimes hard to come by!
