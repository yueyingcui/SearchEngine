Nike In-Season TR II
I really liked these, but as I was told bought an extra 1/2 size bigger (am glad I did) as they do run small, however, I didn't realize how narrow they seem. They fit snug, but after a while the sides of my feet hurt. I am not giving up though, I still like them, I just will have to wear them around more to loosen them up a little. But be aware they do run small and they do run narrow...
