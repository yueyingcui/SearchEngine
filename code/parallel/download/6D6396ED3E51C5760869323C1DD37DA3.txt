ASICS GEL-170â„¢ TR 
Exactly as I had expected (had seen them in store but didn't have my size). Less expensive than store. Fast shipping.
I was very disappointed. I purchased these sneakers last year. I was very pleased with the overall experience. When they became available again, I jumped at the chance to purchase another pair, which fit my orthodic perfectly. The cut of the new sneaker is very narrow. The size 2E width, feels like a medium width. So buyer beware! I will be returning this most recent purchase.
My 14 year old is 6 ft 1 and wears a size 13 womens. It is hard to find nice feminine sneakers for her. She loves them. And I do too!
Love this shoe! I'm an 11 but with socks I'm finally getting smarter and ordering a 1/2 size up when I can find an 11 1/2. These fit perfectly, right out of the box. Yay!
This shoe is very comfortable. Ample cushioning keeps my heels from hurting after being on my feet for 12 hour shifts. Only drawback is that it feels narrow in the width compared to New Balance shoes of the same size and width.
Nice shoes with good support. I never run in shoes like this anymore after trying the 3030 line, but they are great hospital shoes - I'm on my feet all day and don't feel sore. Other reviewers are right: I purchased a half-size smaller than street-shoe size and they fit well.
These are great shoes.  I used to be a runner but am now a walker.  I have a very high arch which requires a shoe with a lot of support and these have that.  Also, I usually wear a size and and I ordered a size 8 and they are a perfect fit.
It runs small and narrow. I ordered a 1/2 size larger & in "wide" but it still didn't fit. I love the look & gel support so will see if I can exchange for even larger size. I wear a 9 D in New Balance & looks like I will wear a 10 2E width in Asics Gel.
