Timberland PRO TiTANÂ® Oxford Safety Toe Low
The Timberland PRO Titans are the most comfortable safety shoe I have ever owned. I just took them for a two mile break-in walk and they were more comfortable than my favorite New Balance sneakers. I normally have to go a size bigger but the size 13 shoes fit perfectly.
I am 295 pounds and I love these boots. They are sturdy, strong, comfortable, light and true to size. I find them to be great walking shoes. The steel holds the shape together great in snow and ice.
Liked the shoe very much. Fit great and was true to size. I bought these ones for work and they keep my feet warm, comfortable, and safe.. I wear them every day.
