Saucony Grid Profile
I cannot begin to say how much I love these shoes. They fit perfectly n my usual size and they are so comfortable. I have high arches and these shoes are great for me. I love them. I used to wear only Nikes but am now a loyal Saucony fan.
Very true to size and extremely comfortable with good support.
So comfortable! I can't use them as a running shoe because I need more support, but these are great for cross-training/weightlifting/looking awesome. I had to order a size up, but they're great.
I loved the color combination of this shoe! It reminds me of Superman! When I received this shoe, I wasn't aware that the tongue of this shoe is attached; just like a tongue of a slip on shoe. I love Saucony and wear a size 10.5, but I could not for the life of me fit my foot into this shoe.
