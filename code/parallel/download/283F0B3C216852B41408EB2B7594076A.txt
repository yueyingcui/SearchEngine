ASICS GEL-Cirrus33â„¢
Great shoe comfort-wise but took 5 days to break in fully. A large amount of cushion and minimal support -- exactly as described. These are my first Asics; I had to order my Nike/Adidas size.

Love these. True to size -- provide great support. Worth every dime.
Am sad that these shoes seem to be making my feet roll to the outsides, maybe due to the fabric.  Made a sore on my toe.  Wish I could send them back, maybe I need a smaller size, since I ordered .5 larger for my orthotics.  Not as comfortable as others.  I should have worn them indoors longer before trusting them.
This sneaker molds to your foot and as I have a high arch it fits perfectly. True to size and glad I paid a little more for a get fit.
