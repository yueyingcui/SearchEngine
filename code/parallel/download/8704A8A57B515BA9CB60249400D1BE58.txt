Nike Nike5 Gato
Everyone needs a brightly colored pair of fun kicks for the summer! I've never seen this color scheme on a pair of Nike's before, and when I got them, I have to admit they were a lot brighter than I even expected from the picture. But I've gotten several compliments on them, and they are extremely comfortable shoes. The one complaint I have is that they were at least a full size smaller than marked. I ordered an 11 in these and Chuck Taylors, and the Chucks fit perfectly, while I had to return these Nike's for a size 12, which fits great. Overall an excellent buy, especially for the price...just be wary of the sizing.
The orange and black one is more pink and heavy gray. Fits true to size though and very comfortable.
