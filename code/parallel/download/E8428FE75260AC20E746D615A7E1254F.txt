Heelys Double Threat (Toddler/Youth/Adult)
My son loves these shoes and has loads of fun with them.  Definitely order a size larger like sizing recommendation states.  My son wears a size 3 consistently, but we ordered a 4 and they fit well.
Amazing shoe! Only took about a day or two to get used to it; now I use it everywhere! I was surprised to find places like king soopers, the mall, tradesmart and public parks all being okay with the use of Heely's. A lot of sites say the sizes run small and to buy one size too large, but mine was perfect at my size (we bought one 1 size too large before and it was unwieldy). People of all ages should get one of these! A side note, these do not have huge ankle support, it's more like a skater shoe (but I haven't noticed any problems and I've never owned skater shoes in the past).
Great shoe. Sizes were spot on, so buy a size larger for growth spurts. Perfect for kid's style cross-training: heeling, skating, running, biking...definitely purchase again.
