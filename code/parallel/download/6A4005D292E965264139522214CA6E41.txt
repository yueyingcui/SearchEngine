Ryka Regulate
I am very happy with these shoes. They are comfortable and support my feet very well. I have not had the opportunity to run in them yet, but I am very much looking forward to it. The only warning that I have is that my actual shoe size is a 5-5.5 and I ordered a 6 and they fit great. I think that someone with a larger foot would say that they are at least a half size too small.
I ordered this show in 1/2 size larger and it fits great.  It has a pretty wide toe base and feels good on my foot even though I recently had bunion surgery.
I have been looking for a running shoe that doesn't look like something my grandfather would wear or that cost me $$$. I have flat feet and overpronate. Ryka Regulate is wonderful! Fashionable in a retro kind of way, the price is great and the support is good. Not great, but good enough for some running and power walking. I am not a fast/strong runner I run a 5k yearly and then maintain my workout with a walk/run combo. I normally wear a size 9.5 and I'll go up to a 10 for my running shoe, I orderd a 10 and it fits the way I want my running shoe to fit. For my more serious training I'll pull out my grandpa shoes but for everything else these's shoes are my favorite!
These are flattering, which is no small consideration at size 10! They are stylish, and ultra-light. They are very nice all-around athletic shoes. I am not sure the sole would grip on wet surfaces very well, but for most uses these are good shoes.
