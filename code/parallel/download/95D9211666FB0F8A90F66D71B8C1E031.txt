Nike Multicourt 10
What a shame these didn't work out! I ordered these for my daughter for volleyball. She normally wears a size 9 and her feet are somewhat wide. I ordered the 9.5 thinking this would help with the width but it did not. Not only did the 9.5 feel like an 8.5 the toe box from the middle top of the foot all the way to the toe is extremely narrow. Too bad, because the price is great and they look cool. 

You are in luck if you have a long narrow foot, get them!
We got these for my daughter to play high school volleyball in and she loves them as much as the higher priced Asics she has worn in the past. The fit was true to size. 
Fit true to size, no break in period needed. Very light shoe with excellent support. I teach fitness dancing and they are great for lateral support.
My daughter loves these shoes. True to size.

Nice looking shoe. It felt true to size, ready to wear right out of box; plan on wearing them on pickleball court tomorrow
