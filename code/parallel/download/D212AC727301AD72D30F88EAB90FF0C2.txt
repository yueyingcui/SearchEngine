Spira Classic Leather
I have chronic knee problems, and chose this shoe in desperation. Good choice! It actually works. Walking no longer gives me pain. But pick a half-size larger, as the shoe is a bit narrow.
Not sure why the shoe feels bigger than what I am used to wearing (Asics). Disappointed the size is so wrong.
I love the sneaker because it is so "cushiony", but if I order it again, I would order it one size larger (with the hope that the ankle would not slide). It ends right at the end of my big toe and I can't wear heavy socks with it. I kept it though because it looks good, it feels wonderful because it is so cushioned (even though a bit short). Definitely order in larger size. Runs a little short, especially if you want to wear socks.
I have had 2 pairs over the past 2 years, bought on the instructions of a foot surgeon. I bought these for severe metatarsalgia - I don't think they helped at all. They are heavy and ugly as sin. Getting used to that strange extension on the inner front of the shoe took a few days.

I am a D width but had orthotics that took me up to an EE, which is what I bought. I needed to buy them 1/2 size longer and lace them in a way in front that did not put pressure on the front of my foot.

I am still in search of a good walking shoe - why don't any have a bit more of a heel - but I was delighted when my new Podiatrist ordered me to stop wearing them.

I found them pretty durable. I never felt the benefit of the springs.
Greatest shoe for those that need a cushy feel because of broken ankle! Only sneaker I can wear. Like walking on a cloud! Buy 1/2 size larger.
I am very disappointed that you are no longer carrying the wider size I have bought my shoes from you for 4 years.
Ordered my usual shoe size but they were too small. Strange after reading the other reviews.
