ASICS Kids Pre-Galaxyâ„¢ 5 (Toddler/Youth)
Excellent shoe! My 6 year old loves these shoes! They are easy for him to put on and he loves the colors. I ordered 1/2 size bigger because his size wasn't available and they fit great.
I bought these shoes for my son who is almost 5 and for his twin sister (in another color).  They fit according to size and are holding up well.
These shoes looks cute and my son loves that they have "laces" as well as velcro. However, they don't wear that well. That black flap on the toe comes unglued or unstitched pretty easily. We have had 2 pairs in the same size already. My son is very hard on his shoes, but these don't seem to stand up well to a 4 1/2 year old boy.
We started a family 5-K training program for our kids. We needed a pair of "good" running shoes in a kids' size 2. These were one of the only options I could find. (I found none locally.) I was worried that the velcro strap wouldn't cinch the shoes tight enough. But, they seem to work perfectly. My son likes them so much, it is hard to keep him wearing them only when we run!
Sturdy, comfortable sneaker for my picky 6 year old.  I like that it has laces so they look like big kid shoes, but they still close with velcro, so he can easily take them on and off.  My son does not have a particularly wide foot, but I found that the wide size in these shoes fit best.  The velco was too short to go across on the regular size.
These are really great shoes for an active five year old that is not quite ready for lace-ups. They provide good support, nice styling and reasonably durable for a nice price. We have had several pairs in multiple sizes.
