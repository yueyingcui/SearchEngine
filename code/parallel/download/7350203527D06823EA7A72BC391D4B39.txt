adidas Originals Kids Dragon-Nylon (Toddler/Youth)
The shoe apparently runs a bit small. After wearing them for two days, my son declared that they were too small and hurting his feet. He went back to his old, "smaller" shoes - smaller labeled size but bigger overall.
Ordered for my 10 year old son. They run a little narrow. We ordered a 1/2 size up, which fits great!
