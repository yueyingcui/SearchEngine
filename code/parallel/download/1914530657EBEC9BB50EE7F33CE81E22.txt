PF Flyers Sumfun Lo
These are pretty stylish and look good with shorts and jeans.  I got them just in time for summer and finally have some PFs.  Look to get a size smaller or half if wearing sockless with shorts.
These shoes look great and are fairly comfortable. Unfortunately I had trouble finding a size that fit properly. Over a range of sizes, they all hit my little toe with an internal seam at that position. The Posture Foundation insole made my feet feel tired by the end of the day and left little room to be able to wiggle my toes. I removed the insoles and the shoes are now much more comfortable--more like Adidas Sambas--but the seam still rubs a little on my little toe. On the plus side, the low-cut sides mean no friction around the ankles.
This is a very nice shoe, though very light in weight.  This shoe is made for easy relaxing summer days.  It looks best worn without socks, so think about getting 1\/2 size smaller.
Awesome!  I slip them on and all of a sudden I\'m ten years old  again.  Who would think that a pair of shoes could make a grown man so happy?  Sure, they don\'t have as much support as a modern pair of shoes. I guess that didn\'t matter when we weighed only 50 pounds. The sizes are a bit tight--I had to return the first pair and order a half-size up, and that\'s in bare feet. \r\n\r\nLove them.
These shoes are so comfy and cute! I wear them with retro skirts, shorts and dresses. I love them. True to size. I'm ordering more colors and buying some for my friends. Great summer shoe.
Great looking shoe, the sizing seemed a bit larger than listed, only by a half size or so. I would probably buy a half size smaller if I bought another pair.
I ordered these shoes a month ago. I love them, they are very low profile, comfortable and fit well. True to size.
