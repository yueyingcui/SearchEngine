Dr. Martens Carrigan Cut-Out Shoe
I have owned a few Docs, boots and shoes. They run big as well as wide. I'm normally an 8.5 or 9, these are marked US size 8. Love the style, though the shiny leather needs a few months to soften, again to be expected with all Docs. Insoles are a must if you have narrow feet.
