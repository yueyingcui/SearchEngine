Native Shoes Corrado
Crocs without the dork factor I've been eye-balling this brand for a while, but two things had me resistant to making a purchase. First, I'm not a fan of either the Keds look, the Docksider, or the "Chuck Taylor". Second, I hate white on my sneakers. So, when the solid color came out on this style, I bought up all the available stock in my size. Now, the shoe. It's swell. It's great in the rain, it's awesome in mud, and it's totally breathable and not clammy. I haven't had mine for too long, but I've already walked in ankle-deep much, mowed the lawn, got them stinky and threw them in the washer. They're great. I wear them all the time. Bottom line: They're Crocs without dorkiness. You kick off your cool looking shoes and you're in your bare feet, it's sweet.
