I really like the shoe, but it runs large and wide. I am returning it for a size down. This shoe is really cute!
I am a 10.5 and have a tough time finding brands that make my size, so I was so excited to see that this style was offered in 10.5. However, it runs large! It felt like an 11. I returned them and ordered a 10. It is just a hair tight on the heel, but I'm sure the leather will stretch a bit. A big plus with this shoe is that the insole comes out so you can put your own orthotic in. The one that comes with the shoe is completely flat with about 1/4" of padding.
