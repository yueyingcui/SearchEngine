Merrell Kids Moab Ventilator (Toddler/Youth)
When my son outgrew his last shoes (the exact same style) I immediately bought the same pair in a bigger size. These shoes are so well made! Super comfortable and they offer a lot of support.
I got these for my son for school.  He loves them.  Says they are comfortable and they are very true to size.  I highly recommend them.  They are sporty but can be worn with nice pants also and still look fine.
This is our third pair of the Ventilator size 13, 1 & 1.5. It is really the only shoe my little guy ever says "yes" to. I've tried least 25 different other shoes on him just for a change and he loves these.
