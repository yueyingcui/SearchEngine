ASICS GEL-Lyte33â„¢
These shoes are awesome but run a bit narrow. I'm not sure if going up 1/2 size will correct this issue...
Very lightweight, which is what I wanted. However, they are very narrow. Also, I would recommend buying a half size up from your normal shoe size. Otherwise there's no toe room. I had to return them.
