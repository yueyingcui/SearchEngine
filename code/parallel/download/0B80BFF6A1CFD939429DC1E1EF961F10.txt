Brooks Tranceâ„¢ 11
These shoes are amazing. Total comfort while running. I marked that they felt a half size smaller than marked because I normally wear a size 13 shoes, but ordered these as a 14 because runners are supposed to go a size up when buying running shoes. These fit my feet perfectly. 
Order 1/2 size up. I had really bad metatarsalga from poor shoe support. My podiatrist recommended this brand. So happy!
These are great shoes, but just like the description reads, they offer a lot of support for feet that pronate.  Mine don't, so I don't need the stiffness they offer.  I tried them for the cushion, but found the same cushiness in the Dyad.  Again, I needed a half size longer in Brooks than I've ever taken.  
The Brooks Trance 11 was a good fit for my size 10 Narrow foot. Brooks shoes don't always run true. Some time I have to skip a year. This year the GTS was too wide in a narrow size.
Brooks Trance 11 is the greatest! I purchased a 1/2 size larger and in a narrow width instead of the medium and they fit! One of the most comfortable fits I have ever had. I felt as though I could have ran a marathon. This is great for a person with plantar fasciitis. Undoubtedly, the best purchase I've ever made. Would highly recommend this shoe to anyone looking for a running or walking shoe. Just take it out of the box and wear - no break-in time! Great!
Beautiful sneaker. Had to return it for wider size. Wish more wider sizes were available. Otherwise great looking sneaker with lots of cushioning.
