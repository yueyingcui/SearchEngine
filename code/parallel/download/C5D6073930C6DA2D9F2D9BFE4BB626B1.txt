Osiris NYC83 Mid W
I ordered this shoe in a size 8, thinking I would have to return it because several reviews stated that they ran small but these fit me perfect and are so comfortable. I will be a lifetime customer. Thanks to Sam, a customer service agent, that answered all my questions and was very helpful. Thanks and keep up the good work.
Love these shoes. I frequently buy Osiris shoes because they last and are very comfortable. I would recommend buying just 1 size up. I'm usually a 6, but purchase a 7 in this brand.
After reading others reviews that these shoes run a bit small I ordered a bigger size and they were right. My daughter loves them and it was the highlight of her x-mas.
These sneakers run incredibly small, we are on our 4th size. My daughter is normally a youth 6 or woman's 5 or 6 and we are probably going for a woman's 9 in these sneakers!
I got the black pair and they are awesome. It is like a black bubble they run small so get a bigger size. Probably the only down side is that it does not come with extra shoe laces. But these are great comfortable shoes!
