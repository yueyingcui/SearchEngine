New Balance WX856
Because of pronation, I've been using this shoe with the rollbar for years. I was nervous about the new style -- 856 instead of 855 -- but it fit like a glove and felt so comfortable. I love it, and now I'm sorry I didn't order two pairs at first. It's now out of stock in my size.
I need a narrow, cross training shoe for gym work.  these are supportive without being too aggressive.  THe fit and feel great immediately.   I wear  a half size larger in New Balance than other shoes.
I am a bit disappointed in this shoe.  Don\'t feel that it is true to size.  I\'ll be going back to the W811 next time.
