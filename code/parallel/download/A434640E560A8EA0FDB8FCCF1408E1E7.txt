Reebok RealFlexâ„¢ Transition 
Great shoes for lateral exercise movements!  Light weight and extremely comfortable.  I bought 1/2 size bigger as I do with all athletic shoes.  Fit perfect!
I finally found a supportive training shoe that sticks when I land! I wear a size 11M but most training shoes are way too wide in the toe box for me and I have difficulty with stability. This shoe gives plenty of room and doesn't assume that my long foot is super wide. They are extremely comfortable and supportive - great to train, jump and do speed and agility drills in. I wish I had found these earlier. I have several pairs of very cute cross trainers in my closet that will never again see the gym. These might run a little on the larger side, but probably not enough to need to size down.
Love my RealFlex.  Had to go up 1/2 size b/c the toe box is a little narrow.  Other than that, they're great!  I received compliments from my students at school, too!
