PF Flyers Kids Center Lo (Toddler/Youth)
I absolutely love these throwbacks! The problem is that they only offer medium width and I had to send the first pair back because the shoe size and width run small! Our four year old son wears a 10, I had to order an 11 for him. These shoes are well made and can endure anything our little boy puts them through!
I bought these for my son who is obsessed with The Sandlot. I am so glad I read the reviews, because the shoes do run smaller. My son wears a size 11.5 and I ordered a 12.5 they fit great and my son loves them!
Just bought them and am exchanging them for a half size bigger. Hope that's enough. My son and I both loved the look of these shoes and are hoping that they last a little better than his Chuck Taylors.
Con, half a size smaller than expected, and too narrow, so order a size to a size and a half up. Pro, indestructible!
