Love these shoes for zumba - was using cross trainers and these are so much lighter and I feel nimble. Can spin like a dream. 

They do not have arch support, but have really good shock absorption for ball of foot - and I only wear them for an hour at a time, so its a good trade-off for me since the ball of my foot was sore post zumba. Had to order a full size up, and it works even tho I have a bunion and need a wider shoe box (video said this was a wider model).
These are great! I wear them to Zumba and they give you the perfect amount of slip to enhance your dancing. I usually wear an 8.5, I ordered a full size up, and they fit nicely. Very cute also I have received many compliments
I wanted good, flexible, but supportive shoes for Zumba, my favorite sport. After trying sport-dancing shoes, cross-training and running shoes, these shoes really fit the bill for pivoting, side to side and jumping movements. I would have preferred a thicker sole for cushioning, but overall these are very comfortable for my feet. I needed one size larger.
