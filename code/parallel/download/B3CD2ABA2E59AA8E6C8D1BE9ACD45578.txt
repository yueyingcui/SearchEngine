PUMA H-Street Wn's 
These shoes are super cute and comfortable. The first day I wore these three people commented on them. They're definitely for running errands/running around town but not for running (if that's what you had in mind). I usually wear an 8.5 in shoes but my toe hit the top of the shoe so I had to go up a size.
