New Balance MW665
I chose this shoe for daily walks, and have been very happy. Light and comfortable, the shoes also breathe very well. I did have to return the first pair and order one a half size bigger (a problem I haven't had with New Balance before).
I have worn NB for years. No longer. Except for their shoes made in the US, their shoes are very poorly made and even the sizes can't be relied upon which is why I gave Comfort a 1 rating.
They are very good for what they are. Probably a little tighter at first but soon stretched to fit.I kept these but ordered another pair a 1/2 size larger and I thought they were just about perfect.
