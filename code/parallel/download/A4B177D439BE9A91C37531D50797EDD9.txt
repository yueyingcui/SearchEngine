Native Shoes Verona
First off, I think they're fantastic! super comfortable right out of the box! It is true what other reviewers say though, they do run large. I normally wear a size 11.5 and ordered these in size 11 and they fit perfectly! My one complaint would be I wish they had a little thicker soles, they are comfortable enough, but I wouldn't walk around on pavement all day with them. Overall they look great feel great and I definitely want more pairs!
Way too narrow for my feet, but fit my girlfriend's. We wear the same size, but I have a very high arch. She is pleased with them.
