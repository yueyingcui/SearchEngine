Columbia Ravenousâ„¢ II
It fits comfortably with a SmartWool sock. I typically wear size 10. My foot is slightly narrower than B width. Style is so-so, but I'm buying it for comfort, not style. I also don't really like the look of sneakers. :-)
I bought these shoes for hiking on trails that consists of hills and rocks. I think the shoes did a great job in keeping me safe from slipping. I would say that they are true to size although I always buy half a size larger with shoes that I am doing heavy activity in. My only concern was that the back part of the shoe kept rubbing against my skin. I am not sure if they were was new and stiff but it was a little uncomfortable. Fortunately, I did not get any blisters. Maybe wear thicker socks? That is my plan the next time that I use them. Hopefully, the more I wear them the more they will loosen up. Overall, I am glad that I purchased these. And also, they look exactly like the picture.
