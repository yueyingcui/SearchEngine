Saucony Progrid Peregrine 2
These are my favorite trail running shoes.  I actually just ordered my second pair.  If you're going to spend time trail running, it's worth investing in the appropriate shoes.  I typically wear a 6 1/2, but I order up a full size.
Awesome, light-weight, and comfy. I'm a 9, but in running shoes I always buy a half size up. I bought these in a 9.5 and they were perfect, so make sure you get a half size up. I use them for hiking and camping. The pink and blue isn't quite as shocking as I thought. Also, I have flat feet and sauconys are always great for that.
