New Balance WC900
I always wear a size 8-wide in New Balance shoes, but these seemed just a little narrower. I'll just wear thinner socks and they should be fine, otherwise they are comfortable.
I have a wide foot...in the toe area...and I have trouble finding shoes that are good-looking and comfortable. This shoe did not fit...I had to send it back. It is too narrow in the toe box, even when I ordered the wide size.
