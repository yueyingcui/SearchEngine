Circa 211
Circa 211 Royal - 
Circa is a great skate shoe. They do feel about a half size to small and maybe a little narrow but they have a great board feel and I have to say they hang together great. I’ve had mine for 2 about 3 weeks and they still hanging together fine, plus they look great. I’ve got many comments from other skaters and just people period.
