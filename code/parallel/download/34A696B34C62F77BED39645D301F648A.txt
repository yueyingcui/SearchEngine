Teva Kids Churn (Toddler/Youth)
These are wonderful shoes for hiking and getting wet in a creek. They are difficult to get on and on the narrow side, my son complains they are too tight although I purchased a half a size too big.
Great shoe for an active kid. A little difficult to get on at first but perfect for all activities. True to size. 
Wow. What a fantastic purchase. My daughter will definitely be getting our money's worth out of them. They are lightweight and super comfortable, even without socks. I originally purchased the Keen water shoes, but they were way too wide for her narrow feet. These are narrower and can tighten right up to fit. I even ordered a size big, and they still can tighten up enough. We got them thinking of summer and camp- I wanted her to have something that could weather anything and protect her feet. Honestly, the best purchase. She asked me the first day if she could wear them outside, and I told her to wear them everywhere. They are great.
