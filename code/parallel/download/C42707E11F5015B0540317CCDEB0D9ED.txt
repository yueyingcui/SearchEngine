PUMA Voltaic 3 NM
I loved the new funky bold colors. They are very comfortable and stylish enough for casual day functions; heck, you can even rock these with a pair of designer jeans, a medium sized belt buckle and a nice woven shirt.
I have enjoyed the PUMA's very much using them everyday on treadmill for 2 miles. They fit well and were the correct size which is usually the risk ordering and not trying them on.
