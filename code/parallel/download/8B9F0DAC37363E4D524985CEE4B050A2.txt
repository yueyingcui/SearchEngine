adidas Sumbrah 
I really wanted these shoes to fit! So cute! Unfortunately, I had to return them. They were all around tight. I do have wider feet, but usually it's not an issue with tennis shoes. The arch support seemed really nice though! All around it's a good shoe once you know to order a half size bigger.
