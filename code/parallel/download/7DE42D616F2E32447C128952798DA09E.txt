The North Face Men's Hedgehog Tall III GTX XCRÂ®
Received these yesterday. Felt true to size although I ordered an 11.5, and received an 11 - they still fit. I don't know if they come in larger half sizes, so toe box is a little snug. I wear a EU 45 and these are 44.5. Great subtle style, and very comfortable.
