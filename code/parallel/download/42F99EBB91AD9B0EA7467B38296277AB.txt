SKECHERS KIDS Twinkle Toes - Shuffles - Bizzy Bunch 83311L (Toddler/Youth)
Just got these last week couldn't find them in stores, grand daughter loves them. Little tight getting on but that's cause they are new, comes with 2 different colors of laces, true to size.
Perfect for the girlie girl who sometimes needs a sporty look! My daughter loves these shoes!! Only downfall is that the shoes were bigger than the measurement on the size chart indicated. I measured my daughters foot and ordered the size she needed according to the chart but they were roughly a full size bigger! She'll just get longer use out of them. :) Overall a great shoes though!
This shoe is excellent.  My daughter loves her new sneaker boots.  It is very comfortable and true to size.  I will purchase another pair for  her as a Christmas gift.

I absolutely love these shoes! They are super cute. The sequins are well attached. They run true to size. They are easy off and on with zippers placed on the shoes. My daughters love them!
