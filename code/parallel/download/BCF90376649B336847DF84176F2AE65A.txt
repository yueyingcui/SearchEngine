ASICS GEL-Blur 33â„¢ TR W
For past few years have worn exclusively Asics for running and my feet thank me. (note re sizing: I wear a half size larger than my regular shoe size) Bought this shoe for gym workouts w/ light cardio. They suit the purpose just fine. I really like the color and breathable mesh top, too. They are definitely a lighter shoe than a traditional running shoe. Not sure I'd use them for long runs.
This is a good shoe; true to size; light weight; comfortable. I wear size 12 and am self-conscious about big feet. These are feminine.
Love love love. Went jogging in these for the first time and they are super comfortable. I ordered a half size up to make sure I had good toe room, and made the perfect decision! Definitely recommend these! Oh and I had tons of compliments on them!
