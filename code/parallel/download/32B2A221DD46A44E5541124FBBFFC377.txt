Brooks Kids Boys Ghost (Youth)
Great shoe -- but at least a whole size or maybe even 1.5 sizes smaller than standard.
Runs a good full size small. My son normally wears a 1.5, ended up purchasing a 2.5 and fits perfectly.
My son loves these shoes! It is hard to find shoes for him. He has a wide foot & high instep. They are lightweight & very comfy. We originally bought a size 6 , but exchanged for a 7. My older son & daughter also have Brooks shoes & say they are the best shoes they ever had.
