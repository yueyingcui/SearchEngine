Salomon Ellipse GORE-TEXÂ®
This is my first trail shoe and I love it.  I have a narrow heel but like an athletic shoe to have plenty of room in the toe box and this one does.  The waterproof feature works as advertised - no wet feet and I've tested them in soggy conditions.  These shoes also seem very stable across a variety of terrain.  Another nice feature is that they weigh very little.  They don't feel heavy or clunky.  I generally wear a size 7.5 or 8 so I ordered these in a size 8 as I have a pair Salomon winter boots that left me with plenty of room in a size 8 and the length of these shoes was comparable to my New Balance running shoes in an 8.5.
If I could suggest one improvement, it would be to offer more color options.
