Nike Kids Air Pegasus 28+ (Youth)
I really needed a half size larger, but it was out of stock. I bought them anyway because my 9 year old son loves them. He says that they are the most comfortable shoes he has ever worn. I had a pair of women's Air Pegasus, and I must concur.
I'm an adult with a small shoe size and a runner.  I often struggle to find a good running shoe in my size.  These shoes are a great fit, light weight, and have a mature look.  The Nike chip feature was an added bonus that I took advantage of and it is working out perfect.  Great pair of shoes, I've considered ordering an additional pair in the other color to alternate.
