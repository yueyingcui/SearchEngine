New Balance W1140
Very comfortable shoe.  Wasn't sure which size to order so I had to reorder a larger size to ensure comfortable fit.  Easy to reorder and prompt service.
Way too short and yet, when I compare the OUTSIDE length to other NB's I own, they are almost as long.  Inside, however, they are way too short and the toe box could use some room in all directions.  A real shame since they seem nicely padded.  I will try a larger size, but I am afraid that they will be too large overall.
I ordered half size bigger than usual but even that was not big enough.  Sadly, returning these.
Unfortunately these are going back. Them seem to run about a 1/2 size small. They are great in the width, but a little short.
