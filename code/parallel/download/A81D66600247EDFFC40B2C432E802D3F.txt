ASICS Gel-AntaresÂ® TR 2
I loved the looks of this shoe.  It's just what I was looking for.  However, it didn't come in wide sizes.  I though it was worth a try to try a medium.  Unfortunately, it was too tight.  I wish they had a wide.  
Comfortable, lightweight, true to size, awesome running shoe or comfortable for being on one's feet.
