These are really great shoes that fit great and are the correct size. They also look great with everything! They are the best!
I sent the first pair back because they are not true to size. I am a 10Â½ and I am re-ordering a 10. I plan to wear them without laces mostly so they cannot be big. I have a pair of Top-Siders and these felt much more giving, like a soft moccasin would. Much nicer footbed the the Top-Siders as well. Hopefully the 10 will fit correctly! I will update this review down the road!
