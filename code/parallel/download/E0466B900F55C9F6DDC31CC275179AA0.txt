Nike Air Max Torch 4
Decent shoe for the price, but my toes are a little cramped. I feel like these are true to size, I wear an 8.5, but my toes find it a little hard to breathe. When I move up to a size 9, then the shoe is simply too long. A little breaking in is required, but once you do, they feel great. Arch support is good, cushioning is ok, style is good.
