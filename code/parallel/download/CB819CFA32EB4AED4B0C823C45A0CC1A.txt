ASICS GEL-Noosa Triâ„¢ 7
These are great shoes. They run true to size. They were a birthday gift for my boyfriend, and he picked them out. He loves them!
This one is very comfort and cute. I tried this for running without socks. Wow, very light and enough support for my back problem. It was true to size (same as other Asics model).
Love these shoes and get compliments on them all the time. True to size. I like a bit more arch support so I added my own. Perfect!
I had to get different size, great to work with. Sent me email to ship back free the ones that I didn't want before even sending them back; overnighted me a new pair. Great company!
I love these shoes so much! I have always gone with Asics, so I already knew my size and that I would love them. I get comments on how cool my shoes are every day, so if you don't like being noticed, don't get these bright shoes! The glow in the dark effect is cool too, in case you like to run at night.
