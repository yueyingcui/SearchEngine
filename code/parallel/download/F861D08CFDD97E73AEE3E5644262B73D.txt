Osiris Pixel
These are skate shoes, and very well padded, so the smaller size is to be expected. My feet are pretty narrow, so I can't judge width for the average person, but I'd say the padding probably has an effect there too. They're gorgeous, comfortable, and reasonably light. The only complaint I have is that the tongue logo is right under the laces.
The pixels felt true to form in size and width. I have only had them for a month but am not disappointed in them. So far they have held up well with everything I have thrown at them.
This shoe is does not have leather upper. It's synthetic on nearly all parts and it is way to small for the marked size.
Ordered these shoes when there were only 2 pairs left in my size; was debating whether or not to get them, but glad I did!
The shoe looks awesome. Very narrow though and the size 11 that I bought is smaller than the 10 1/2 Rockports I bought with them. Really wanted them to fit, but had to send them back because of size.
