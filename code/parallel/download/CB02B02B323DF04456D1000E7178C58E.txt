PUMA PowerCat 3.12 IT
My best advice is "Avoid this shoe!" Whereas I've had Puma merchandise before - this was my first pair of Puma shoes - total rubbish! I normally wear a size 10.5 (medium), occasionally an 11. I ordered size 11 - and they felt as if they were closer to a 10 Narrow! My second attempt at Puma shoes...and likely my last! I'm going back to Nike! Even if the size was okay - the "patent leather" look is very cheap...horrible shoe.
