GoLite Neon Lite
These shoes are the best! I now have 3 pairs of Golite shoes and have cleaned out my closet of my many other hardly worn shoes. You have to love the ability to control the width with the inserts included. I have a wide foot and found these shoes really comfortable. They are light and flexible and they look good. The gummy sole makes them stable and a bit cushiony. No complaints, except maybe a few more colors in this style would be good. They do run a bit small so order a half size up. I ordered the same size as I take in Keens and it worked out fine.
