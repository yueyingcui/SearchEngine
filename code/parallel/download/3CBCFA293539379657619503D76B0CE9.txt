Vivobarefoot Lucy Lite
My favorite shoes ever. Just like being barefoot, only protected. I did go half size larger than usual and they have lots of toe room.
I can't give a top rating since I haven't tested them for running yet, although as a casual shoe, it works quite well. I have worn these a couple times and found them comfortable. The insole and sole fit well. Not sure how they'll hold up on concrete and pavement. These seem true to size with just a touch of room for swollen feet, and my medium width feet aren't side-hemmed. The tongue stays in place. The laces are spongy, presumably for grip.
They look exactly like the picture. They are soft and comfortable. It is highly recommended that you order a bigger size than you normally wear.
This is the best minimalist running shoe I've found so far. My feet are really wide, and this shoe is actually wide enough for them. The shoe is also very soft on the inside with no bothersome seams so I can run in them without socks. The shoe also has excellent ground feel. I wear an 8.5 in a traditional, cushioned running shoe, and a size 8 in casual shoes, and I bought these in a size 9 so I would recommend going up 1/2-1 size from your normal shoe size. I marked that it felt true to width because it is advertised as an ultra wide shoe.
