Vans Kids Classic Slip-On Core (Infant/Toddler)
Love these shoes! They ran a whole size too big for my son so he wears an 8 in this shoe and normally a size 9 toddler. They are absolutely adorable! 
These are the cutest shoes. My son loves them and insists on wearing them all the time. They are easy to pull on and even my 3 year old can do it himself. Be sure to order one size smaller than your child measures. They run big. Great purchase!!
So cute when they are this small. True to size. Worth it, my son loves them and I love that they are slip ons.
I ordered these because I love having plain white shoes for my daughter. They are the right size for her feet on the size chart, but they are huge on her feet! Part of the problem is the height of the inside of the shoe - her foot was half an inch below the top of the shoes, which meant when she walked the shoes moved up and down on her feet. She likes them and says they are fine, but I went ahead and bought a pair of Nikes with Velcro (alas, not plain white) so that we could snug them up to her feet better.
These run about one size large (similar to Converse). Ordered a 9.5 for my 3 year old who just measured 9.5 at Stride Rite. They are at least one size too big. We'll try the 8.5 instead.
These look so cute on my little boy's feet I can hardly stand it! He does have Fred Flintstone feet so they are a little bit of a challenge to get on, but I ordered them a half a size bigger so it's not too bad. Love these little shoes!
I ordered these in white size 9.5 for my 4 year old son and they came with a stain on the back. Not to mention they were about a 1/2 size too big for him. They also seemed kinda wide, they went back immediately!
My son loves these! They are so great we ordered them in two sizes. One for now, and one for later when he grows out of the first!
I bought these for my niece and she loves them.  They fit true to size and they must be comfortable because she doesn\'t want to take them off!
