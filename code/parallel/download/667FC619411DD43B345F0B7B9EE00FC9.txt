Jumping Jacks Kids Cheerleader III (Toddler/Youth)
These are really cute shoes. My daughter wears them every day with her school uniform. She says they are very comfortable. I think they run a half size too small though. My daughter normally wears a size 12 so I originally ordered her a 12 1/2 so it would last the entire school year but they just fit so I had to send them back. She is wearing the size 13 and they are perfect with a little room to grow.
