New Balance W770v2
These shoes are wonderful.  I have very small feet, size 5 wide, and that is the size I ordered.  They fit perfect, and are light weight and so comfortable. I recommend them to anyone who is considering them.  Don't pass these up!

I had the older version of this and wore them out.  I forget how great it feels to be sporting a new pair of runners and to feel all bouncy!  They fit true to size.  I'm a 7.5.  I have narrower feet but I ordered the regular/medium width and they fit just fine.  The only complaint I have is that I wish they made them in all pink like the previous pair of S.Komen that I had.  
Great shoe. Love the support. My first pair of New Balance and I was very satisfied. I wear a size 12 and they fit perfectly.
Another great shoe from New Balance. I am a huge New Balance fan, but lately their sizes seem to be getting a little wonky. Everything seems to be a little longer and wider than in the past. This shoe however is true to size. I have taken a 9.5W in New Balance for years, and that holds true for this shoe as well. Besides the fact that it is really cute. I am someone who moderately overpronates and has a somewhat wide foot. This shoe works for me. 
My sweet New Balance sneak just arrived. At least 1 or 2 days before I expected by the way. I'm trying them on right now around the house. I debated on getting the 7.5 just to compare but I went with the 8 only and it runs true to size and as soon as I had them on and stood up...aahhhhh. Love. I can't wait to hit to hit the track tomorrow. I might even pick up another pair for work. Long 12 hour shifts. Might feel pretty nice. The arch support is making my work jungle mocs feel pretty sloppy. Anyway this is about running and I think it's going to be great. I don't even want to take them off! I love the Komen pink.
