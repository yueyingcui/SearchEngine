Merrell Kids Flux Glove (Infant/Toddler)
Thank you, Merrell! Since Preschoolians imploded, I have been looking for another barefoot style shoe for our two year old. I have bought these unseen, fully expecting to return them. They are my favorite kid's shoes ever. They are very pliable, and sturdy, super cute, and stable. The kid loves them, and he is hard to get into anything but Crocs. I will be back for the next size up.
