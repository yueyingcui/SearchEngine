adidas Originals Kids Gazelle 2 (Toddler/Youth)
My son loves these. They are a little narrow but otherwise true to size. They are suede so hopefully he won't trash them in mud puddles.
These are the most adorable sneakers but so far - we have not been able to find the right size!  They appear to run super big! Either that, or I'm used to Puma's running small!
