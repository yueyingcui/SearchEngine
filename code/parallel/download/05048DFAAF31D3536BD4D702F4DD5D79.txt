The North Face Men's Hedgefrog II
I was happy with my choice of this shoe.   Water shoes tend to accumulate rocks, sand, etc. in the bottom.    The open back helps flush this stuff out better than other shoes I have tried.  They are comfortable, easy to put on and off, and dry quickly.  I did have to exchange them because my usual size was too large.   Perhaps because you don't wear socks with these.
