Rockport Zana - Walking Sneaker
Love these shoes!  It is so difficult for me to find shoes in my size that fit well.  My feet are small (size 5 1/2 or 6 depending on brand) and extra wide with high arches and high insteps.  Thse shoes fit like a dream, have great support, and look terrific.  They were comfortable right out of the box and needed virtually zero time to break them in.  I'll be back!
I liked these sneakers. I even ordered the white color; it looks like beige instead. But it's really comfortable. It is true to the size. I love it.
