Nike Action Avid - Canvas
Comfortable enough, though the toe is pretty narrow and eventually my toes feel cramped. You may want to size up a half size in these for that reason.
Beautiful casual shoes. Well made, but not for sports. Canvas, not leather, so they may be less easily stained. I ordered size 9 and they were undersized, so I am sending them back. When compared with my other shoes, these were 3/4" shorter! Not sure if this is true for the model, or just the pair that I received. I liked them, though, and will reorder in size 9 1/2.
Love these shoes. Look and fit great. Definitely true to size. Would buy again! Great casual with jeans shorts and khakis.
I purchased these for my teenage son, they are the only shoes he wears.  They never rubbed wrong, were always comfortable.  Now I need to order a larger size.  Growth spurt!
Very lightweight and comfortable. Have taken long walks through Manhattan and Brooklyn with these and they feel very good. Runs just a little narrow on my right foot, though, but that may be more of my feet than the shoe size.
These shoes are as awesome as they look. Super light-weight and true to size. Recommend!
