Vivobarefoot Ultra L
I just bought these shoes from the 6pm outlet here in Sheperdsville, Kentucky. As someone who hates shoes, I absolutely love these. They are the most comfortable shoes that I have ever put on, and it feels like a big hug for your feet. I feel like the soles were custom made for my feet. The only problem I have is the insoles makes the shoes about half a size smaller and thus a little tight for me. The insoles are the best part! They are great to wear without the insoles as well. These are my first pair of barefoots and I think I found my new favorite shoes! Please keep this style around for awhile.
Love these shoes! I go barefoot a lot as I take/instruct taekwondo. Sneakers of any kind really feel confining to me. So I am thrilled to find these are light and airy, you can walk all day in them. We are about to embark on a trip to Spain, Portugal and Morocco and these are the only sneakers I am taking. Hubby just ordered a pair since I am so happy and they are light enough for travel. They fit true to size and have a wide toe box area which fits my feet perfect. I also love the sock insert that you can remove for beach/water wear. I can't say enough good things about these great shoes.
