Keen Kids Libby MJ (Infant/Toddler)
These are my favorite shoes to get my daughter. We have bought them in 3 sizes so far, and as long as she keeps growing, we will keep getting this shoe. It is cute enough to wear with just about anything and sturdy enough to wear every day. She wears them camping, hiking, playing in the yard, and in every season. Perfect all around shoe.
