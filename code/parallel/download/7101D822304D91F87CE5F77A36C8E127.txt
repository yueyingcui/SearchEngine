Pearl Izumi Tri Fly IV
This is an excellent shoe, I can't believe you get so much for such a bargain price. If you get the right size (the chart is pretty accurate), the shoe will feel comfortably snug, but not tight. Taking them off in and putting them on is made easy with the big velcro strap and if you do triathlons it is a great feature. Stiffness is quite good and they look terrific! Enough said
First thing I noticed is the strap to goes over the top of the foot, not the small one in the very front, but the larger one seems to be 2 issues. The large strap is wavy as if there is extra leather and it bunches and is ripply looking. It's almost as if it wasn't cut during assembly correctly even when its strapped over my feet. The other issues is that the same large strap hits the top of my ankle. I have small ankles (I'm 153lbs). Very annoying. I did get some hot spots on both feet and had to get out of the shoes while riding 4 hours last weekend. This could be due to misplacement of my speed play adapter. I think they look better than the Specialized TriVent and they are certainly more comfortable. I am a size 10us and ordered the 44. My right big toe was hitting the end o the shoe so I am ordering a 44.5. They say order shoes t be snug, bu if you are training or Iron-Man and anything hits your toes fr 112 miles, um... no. A little extra room is needed for the marathon. Cant decide? Have a look at the new Bontrager XLS HiLo 2012 shoe. Similar design very nice! Hope this helps you.
