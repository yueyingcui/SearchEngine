Shimano SH-R087G
My husband and I each got these shoes to use for spin class and with our road bikes. They are great shoes! The Velcro and ratcheting straps help snug them up on my narrower feet, and his wide shoes fit very well. For reference - I wear a women's size 12 and the 45 medium fits perfectly. My husband wears size 15, and he tried both the 50 medium and 51 wide. He kept the 51s as his toes hit the top of the 50s, which would be uncomfortable when standing while pedaling. It was easy to install the cleats, and these shoes are really helping with our bike training.
Finding riding shoes for me has been tough. I run quite a bit too and wear a Brooks Addiction in size 10, E width. My Shimano's are a size 43 and fit perfectly. Go figure! I think the top buckle is a must, much easier to adjust on the go accurately vs a three velcro attaching system. These are great shoes for the money, just wish they came in all black!
Great shoe. I usually wear an extra wide (4E), but by getting the wide version of this shoe in a bit larger size than normal, it fits just fine.
Great shoe for the price.  Light, rigid sole, good closures (velcro+ratchet).  Unlike other reviews though I found the shoe to be a full size larger than marked, and had to go down from my usual 43 to a 42.
