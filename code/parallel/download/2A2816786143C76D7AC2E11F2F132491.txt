adidas Kids Ezeiro III TRX FG (Toddler/Youth)
My son loves these shoes! Since my daughter already had a pair of Adidas soccer shoes, I ordered a full size larger than his sneakers and they fit perfectly! I would definitely say these run a full size smaller than other shoes, Adidas or otherwise. He has had two games and two practices thus far and no complaints from either of us!
Good quality soccer cleats for a reasonable price.  Nice to find a smaller size available online. Thick soccer socks make these seem a little smaller than expected.  But with thinner socks they work well, are comfortable, and look good.
These run small!  My son wears this size in all other shoes and these wouldn't fit on his feet.  I am returning them.
