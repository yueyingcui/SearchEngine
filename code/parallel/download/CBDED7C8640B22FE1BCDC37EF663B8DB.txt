Vasque Velocity
This is a great shoe! I like them so much that this is the second pair I have purchased. I wore the first pair for about two years and finally the soles started to wear smooth so I decided to replace them with the same model. My first pair was a bit snug because I use Superfeet insoles in them so I went up a size this pair. They are very comfortable and durable. I have used them for everything fro running to competitive shooting and I was never disappointed!
Gosh I loved these shoes. Went through 4 pairs of them, adding up to a good 1300 miles of trail running. I tried the VST model once Vasque moved on from this one, but it is just not the same. I have been trying to find old stock of the original Velocity in my size but have had no luck. 
WIDE - 
I purchased these shoes for running on gravel on a road near where I live. These shoes have great tread and have a hard plastic arch support on the bottom center of the shoe. I am a person with wide feet (ordered regular size not wides) and these shoes fit great and there is still enough room inside of them to fit in a insole without cutting off circulation. They are an extremely light shoe for a trail runner. This is an overall great shoe that can be used for everyday walking or trail running. Oh, yea and the steel blue color is nice, great looking shoe!

Pleased beyond belief - 
Bought these for a fast/light hike through the White Mountains. Right out of the box, fit was tremendous - as the laces get really snug and pull the shoe tight around the foot. I bought a size 12 (to leave a finger width at the toes), and the fit was/is great. I am looking forward to some trail runs in these babies.

Very good wide shoe - 
The shoe is pretty comfortable, especially in the wide size, which many sneakers do not have.
