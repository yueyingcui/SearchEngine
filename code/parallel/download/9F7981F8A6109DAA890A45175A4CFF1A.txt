Nike Kids JR T90 Shoot IV FG (Toddler/Youth)
Shoes were good quality and wonderful color! Will have to return though. They ran a little small, half size approximately.
When my 6-year-old son went to soccer camp this summer, he discovered that cleats come in COLORS! Of course he had to have some new kicks for the fall. He wore them proudly yesterday at the kickoff. He says they are comfortable. They are true to size-I got him a 2.5 and I'm glad I did! (Yeah, big feet, I know...) Easy to tie and they stay tied, and they are very handsome.
We purchased these for my son's soccer camp. He loved the colors (turquoise) and said they were very comfy. As other reviewers have stated, the shoelaces were a little shorter than most I've seen, but I had no probs double-knotting. It was also true to size. Overall, my son and I would highly recommend these shoes.
