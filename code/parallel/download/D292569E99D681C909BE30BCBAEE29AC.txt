Avia A5020W
Returned a pair of Saucony that weren't going to work with my overpronating wide feet, and began to look for shoes that would work. I put my size, 9W, in the search engine, and these Avia came up. The price was less than the Saucony, and the reviews were great! They arrived today, so I put them on and did a 40 minute walk on the treadmill. Great cushioning and most importantly, support. I could really tell a difference in these compared to my old running shoes. I walk, don't run, but do wear running shoes instead of walking shoes. Value is important, but if the shoes don't work, the price doesn't mean much. These shoes fit the bill!
Comfortable and light in weight Tennis shoe. The fit seems true to size. I got the wide width. I took a 2 mile walk in them the first day I wore them. Seems like they do not need breaking in time. My foot sits straight in it. Many tennis shoes make my feet turn inwards; which makes it very uncomfortable for walking. The pink and gray are nice colors. Great shoe!
True to size with great arch support. Great price, so glad I ordered them.
