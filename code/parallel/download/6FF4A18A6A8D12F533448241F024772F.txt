Vivienne Westwood MAN Trainer
Bought these sneakers because of the cool woven style of the material and the velcro straps look. Unfortunately the left shoe was half a size smaller than the right shoe. That being said the right sneaker (which fit) was the most uncomfortable piece of footwear that I've ever worn. Total disappointment because it's a great looking piece.
