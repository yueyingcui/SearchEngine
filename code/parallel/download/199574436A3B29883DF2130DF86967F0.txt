Big Buddha Rilo
Whoever wears a 6 and says a 6 "fits like a charm" is just encouraging others to buy shoes that were mis-labeled and will cut your feet like razor blades the way they are made. Big problem at the factory because I have Big Buddha shoes in my size in another style that work great. After making my feet bleed walking the span of one NY block, I had to take them off and walk barefoot and bleeding to make it home and throw them in the trash. Will not be buying any more shoes from a manufacturer who doesn't even test their product.
These are very Cute! But it ends there. Please order a full size up. They are very narrow in the front and a bit stiff everywhere else. I had to return them.
I am an 8. Always been an 8. I put these on and they fit tightly, and I thought they would slacken. They murdered my feet through out the whole day. Way too narrow at the front and don't fit true to size. They look very cool, however they lie. Order half a size up. If they fit like a glove they'll be a pain.
