The North Face Kids Betasso (Toddler/Youth)
My five year old wore those throughout the late fall / winter - easy to put on and take off, comfortable, true to the size. Held up pretty well, too.
My 10 year old daughter is picky about her shoes. We went through several before we found these. She wanted comfort, arch support, and pink. These shoes met all there criteria, so we're happy. I find sizing in youth shoes very difficult. I'd say the youth size 6 that we ended up with are equivalent to an adult size 7.5.
My daughter loves to wear this shoe and says that it's very comfortable. It's easy to get on and off, runs true to size, and it's very cute. Not clunky like some other athletic shoe styles.
My son loves these shoes. They are true to size and very comfortable. After a couple months the shoe started to come apart at the toe, but I would still recommend these and buy them again.
Great all around shoe for my 5 year old son.  He needed something for our summer in Colorado that was rugged, but could still wear to school.  The size seemed to run a little small - we went up one size.
