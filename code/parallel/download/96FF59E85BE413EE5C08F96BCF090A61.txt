New Balance M2040
I was buying New Balance shoes from over two decades. I pick the highest number in New Balance for my tennis and running. I bought this shoe recently and is a great addition to my athletic pursuits. It is comfortable, great cushioning, support, fits true to size. Helps work out longer hours running or walking, etc. I would say buy this shoe if you love yourself and see yourself healthy soon.
