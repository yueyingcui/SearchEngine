New Balance W780V2
I finally found a comfortable, lightweight shoe that is not built on the 'barefoot' principle. Having a larger (size 10) and wider foot, I have a hard time finding comfortable running shoes in wide widths. I do not always buy wide widths, but having purchased the grey/green in a 10 wide proves that I have been missing out on true comfort. While I would not necessarily run a marathon or do any distance running in these, they are a great all-around athletic shoe for walking, jogging, gym activities. If you need arch support, I would recommend using an orthotic. Although my foot is wider, I could likely wear the normal B width and be fine. Another plus to these shoes is how breathable they are. The mesh material really does let air flow unlike any other shoe I have owned. Prior to these, I have worn 2 different pairs of Reeboks with the Zig technology which I also really like. I just prefer my athletic shoes to have decent amount of cushion and these are just right! New Balance has never let me down. Another happy NB customer!
