SKECHERS D'lites - Airy
Comfy but a little bulky - 
These are cute and comfortable, but a little bulkier than I anticipated. The top of the shoe goes very far back on the foot for a slide, the heel is extremely chunky, and the toe is big and round. If you are a half-size, I'd go with a size down. That said, they are adjustable because of the laces and still cute and extremely comfortable despite their size. Also much better than similar canvas shoes because scuffs can be covered with white polish.

Great comfy shoe - 
These are very cute and comfortable, too. I love that you can adjust the fit with the laces, and slip them on and run! These feel true to size, but if you're in-between, you may want to size down to make them a little more snug since you can loosen the laces.
