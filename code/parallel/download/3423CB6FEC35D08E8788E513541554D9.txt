Nike Air Max Healthwalker+ 8
Most comfortable tennis shoes I've ever had by far. They do run a 1/2 to a full size small.
I purchased the size I know I need from Nike. The left shoe is a little tight. Kind of disappointing.
Finding a comfortable pair of shoes in size 15 is pretty tough, but these fit really well and were very comfortable. I'm thinking of just buying another pair to have around for when these get worn out.
After falling on an icy/snowy sidewalk with worn out running shoes I was looking for a dependable walking shoe. This is it. The Nike Air Max Health Walker has an aggressive tread, firm support, excellent comfort, and it's well made. One shortcoming is it does not come in extra wide sizes, only medium width, so I had to buy one oversize and put a pad in to fit. I have bought a second pair to alternate use. Highly recommended!

I have a problem with my feet hurting and these are great...they do run small, as I normally take a 11.5 and in these took a size 13. Really like them and make my feet feel great.
This is a very nice looking and comfortable sneaker. I found it to fit true to size which for me means one full size larger than my shoe size (shoe size is 8D sneaker size is 9). One thing I like about this sneaker is that there is no pull-on loop at the heel to interfere with your pant cuff.
