Capezio Kids Rockit - DS24C  (Toddler/Youth)
Capezio has ridiculous sizing. My daughter wears a size 13 (and has a fairly narrow foot). I first ordered her a size 1 and 1.5 due to what the other reviewers had said. Not even close. I then ordered a 2 and a 2.5. The 2.5 is okay, but ideally she'd be in the 3. One other review stated this discrepancy, but I just didn't believe it could be so...well, I was wrong! The shoe runs almost three sizes larger than marked...no space to check this below!
I bought these shoes for my daughter for dance. \\r\\nPurchased from the dance studio.\\r\\nThey were great shoes and held up very well. However - Beware - They run extremely smaller than your actual shoe size. I ended up buying my\\r\\ndaughters shoes 2 sizes bigger than her tennis shoe size.\\r\\n
These shoes were half the size of my son\'s foot.  It was completely ridiculous and Capezio said they run 2 sizes smaller.  I agree.
