Keen Kids Alamosa (Toddler/Youth)
I really wanted to love these shoes but they were very hard them on my toddler to the point where it hurt his foot to get it in, but once on they look good and rugged and my son didn't complain to wear them. My son was almost a size 8 so that is what I ordered and his feet aren't too chubby. The draw string is useless to make the shoe easier to get on. In the picture there looks like there is quite a bit of slack but really it doesn't do much good. Because the shoe was such a pain to get on (for both of us) he didn't get much use out of them. I also think it is kind of hard to tell when they have out grown the shoe since you can't really feel where the toes are because the front is so stiff and rubbery. My older son who is a size 2 with narrow feet has had no complaint with this same shoe and doesn't mind wearing them, but even with his skinny narrow feet he has to put a little extra effort to put them on.
I bought these for my almost 4yo to replace some Keens he'd outgrown. With XXW feet we always buy a size up, and so far he loves them. Survived puddles as advertised!

My son loves these shoes!! We love Keens they are so comfortable and durable. Especially for boys. They run about a size too small.

Great shoes. My son runs around in them comfortably all day long. They are a little bit hard to get on though. Maybe order a size up.
