Speedo Team USA Canvas Slip-on
These are great, really comfortable slip ons. The fit is a little strange. I ordered my first pair a little below my normal size (11 instead of 11 and a half) because they didn't have it. I then ordered a 12 and they're slightly loose, but a much better fit than the 11's. My only complaint is that there wasn't a closer fit. Otherwise, they're great casual/walking shoes.
