Nike Kids Baller Slip 2 (Toddler/Youth)
I purchased a size 5 & 5 1\/2, since the 5 were so tight, I thought the 5 1\/2 would add some space to the toe area.  Unfortunately, both sneakers were cut so narrow my son could not keep them.  Last year this same sneaker (Nike Baller Slip 1) was made in leather, and allowed for breaking in and stretching of the leather.  I thought these would be the same, but the material is so hard that there is no chance of ever stretching them.  Too bad Nike doesn\'t take into consideration that many boys have slightly wide feet.  This shoe will never work on anyone with anything more than a narrow foot.  They are crazy tight.
