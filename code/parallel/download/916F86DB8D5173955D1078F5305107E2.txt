Wilson W Tour Construkt
Love these ahoes.  I need extra width in toebox which these shoes have.  Although toebox is wide the rest of the shoe is glove like fit.  I'm so glad I tried these after having squished little toes forever.  Shoe is comfortable for hours on the court;  I do use orthotics instead of included insole.  Shoe also definetely run small.  Buy 1/2 to 1 size larger than you normally would.
