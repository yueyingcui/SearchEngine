inov-8 Recoliteâ„¢ 190
We got these shoes for my husband to wear while he walks to and then into a nearby creek. They are sturdy enough for him to walk safely through the woods, and then they're just perfect for walking in the creek. They protect his feet and don't get heavy when wet. He says they are ideal for the purpose. He normally wears a size 12 shoe, and the size 12 in this shoe fit him perfectly.
I love these sneakers. They are the most comfortable things I have ever worn. Wear them all day long just kicking around, but I also have worn them for four and five mile walks and was quite pleased. Nice for warm weather when socks and regular sneakers add to the heat. I did take the advice of other comments here and ordered a half size smaller.
Overall, I really like these shoes, I bought them for hiking in warm weather. My only complaint is that they do not make half sizes. I typically wear 8 1/2 or 9. On settled on the 9, but should have probably gone with an 8.
These just might be my favorite shoes ever. They're light, comfortable, and I wear them everywhere. Most of my other shoes are Nikes, and the Inov8s seem to be about a half size smaller. (I wear a 10.5 in Nike, 11 in Inov8.)
I absolutely love these shoes. Be sure to order half a size smaller than what you normally wear for a good fit. These are some of the most comfortable shoes that I have ever worn.
Super lightweight, breathe very well, sized to wrap comfortably around your foot rather than just being a big clunky shoe with some hole in it like cheaper versions of this type are. 

I wear size 9 womens, but the 9.5W was too large and the 8.5W seemed too small at first. I have high insteps, so I took out the insole and these now fit fine. I don't need the insoles but will keep them if these shoes seem to stretch out. Wish they came in half sizes.
Great shoe very comfortable. Unfortunately my size wasn't available so I tried a size up and it's too big.
