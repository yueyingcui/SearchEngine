Puma Kids Puma S Vulc V (Infant/Toddler/Youth)
My six year old son cannot take these off his feet. He loves them so much. People have been complimenting him on the right and left. I bought them a size too large by accident and they are actually fine being a bit too big. The elastic/Velcro closures keep them on his feet well and I am happy that they will last longer (more time for him to grow into and then out grow) them!
These shoes are my 5 year old son's favorite. They run true to size, are easy to get on, and he thinks they're really "cool."
