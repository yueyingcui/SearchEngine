Vans Classic Slip-Onâ„¢
Super cute and comfortable. They run slightly 1/2 a size bigger. They are versitile. The color is a faded green rather than a deep green. Still very cool shoes.
My first pair of vans, I was concerned how stiff they were when I got them, but they loosened up to be very comfortable within two weeks. Coming from a converse high-top aficionado, they are a touch smaller than converse of the same size. But I like them.
When I received the shoe, the first thing I noticed was the poor craftsmanship. The rubber sole in the back seemed to be overlapped on itself, melted together, then they put the Vans logo on top of this causing a good sized bulge on the back of the rubber portion of the shoe. The style looks great, I would definitely order a full or half size bigger, if I was to order this shoe again. When I put on the shoe with socks, it was very cramped and my toenails would rub the top portion of fabric, and when I tried the suggestion of no socks, I knew then it just wasn't going to happen. I didn't even bother trying the other shoe on.
They're Vans. Either you love them or hate them. I love them. As always, Vans Classic Slip-Ons are consistently sized & comfortable.
I've been rediscovering Vans more recently after wearing many older styles back in the day. I've had pair of classic slip-ons in gray in 9.5 and they've been great. I just received these Chambray Black slip-ons in 9.5 and they felt noticeable larger where I was stepping out of the shoe. Small sample size, but definitely a discrepancy in 9.5's. Not sure if it's the Chambray Blacks I just received or my old gray ones.
These are awesome shoes. I used to wear them in High School and decided it was time to get a new pair of shoes to replace my converse because they die kinda fast in the city. I bought these in a half size up since they're kinda skinny shoes naturally. They fit perfect now!
