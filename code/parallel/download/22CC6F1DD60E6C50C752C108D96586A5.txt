Hush Puppies Power Walker II
The shoes fit very good and true to the size. Also very comfortable shoes. I would recommend them.
Looking for walking shoes. This was nice. This Hush Puppies fits in a size half smaller than comparable Propet and New Balance shoes. Propets fit me the best and for the 2 pairs I own, one blue and one white, I prefer the look of their leather.
I look for every possible excuse to wear these comfortable, perfectly fitting shoes! It is like walking on Cloud 9! They were shipped immediately and from the moment I tried them on, I knew these were the shoes for me. I wear a WW and these are roomy but not over-sized; just curved to the foot and supportive. I will order more as they they become available in my hard-to-fit size 10 WW. These shoes are the best!
