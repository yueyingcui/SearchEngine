Ryka Ultima Run 2â„¢
Love these shoes. I train and run several races each year. This is my 5th pair of Ryka's and I will never buy another brand if at all possible. I normally buy a size too big for running room and this pair ran big so I had to return and get a 1/2 size smaller. The return was a breeze! A return label was provided to me and I already had my new pair before I got a chance to send the others out UPS.
This is my 2nd pair of Ryka athletic shoes. No break-in time at all. Very light. I ordered 1/2 a size up for space when running and they fit great. Slightly wider toe box for running. Anyone wanting a more snug fit may want to order their regular size. Not a big arch in the shoe.
Great fit! Very comfortable. I just starting to jog a little and these shoes are so comfortable. I got a half size larger and they are perfect. Great price also!
