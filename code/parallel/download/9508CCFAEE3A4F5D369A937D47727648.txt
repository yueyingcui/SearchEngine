Orthaheel Walker Men
The shoes are, as another reviewer pointed out, a poor quality shoe wrapped around a reasonably good insert. They fell apart after four months of wear. I don't expect that from a shoe in this price range. And they're huge. I bought the regular size and they're way too long but I needed a shoe so I kept them rather than going through the gyrations of sending them back. i won't buy them again and certainly wouldn't recommend them. I suggest you buy a better shoe and purchase a good insole separately. They are definitely not worth the price.
Normally wear a 10, but had to go up 1/2 size. Very attractive. Laces snug without pain across top of ankle like many similar shoes.
