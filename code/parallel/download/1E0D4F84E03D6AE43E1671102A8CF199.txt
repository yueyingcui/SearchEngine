Keen Palisades
Great shoe. Lots of room in toe box. Is a little shorter, so order 1/2 size larger. Felt great first time I put them on. Wore them the entire day
Would recommend highly!
I love them. They run true to size for thin socks only. I have flat feet and use inserts and these shoes work well. I am happy to add a couple of inches to my height.
I usually wear a 7.5 street shoe. A friend said Palisades run small and she was right. I ordered a size 8 and they fit perfectly with my wool hiking socks. The shoes are durable and so far have proven to be water resistant yet breathable.
