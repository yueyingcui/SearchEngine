Supra TK Society Mid
My first pair was the Supra Sky Top II in duct tape white, and these sick kicks rock with skinny jeans. I originally wanted the Supra Sky Top in grey suede but they were sold out everywhere. If you know anyone with a size 9 or 9 1/2 (used and worn okay) email me at skatesneakfreak@yahoo.com. As an alternative and wanting a grey pair I opted for the Supra TK Society Mid and without any regrets, I might add, as they are extremely comfortable and the styling is awesome (love the rear view of the shoe) and again they look great with skinny jeans too.
Just got the Grey Tuf ones today. The shoe is comfortable and provides good ankle support. Most Supra styles are either too high or too low and these mids are perfect height. The shoes compliment themselves as I already received a couple compliments. I don't know if my socks were too thin but the shoe feels a little bigger than what my shoe size is. Overall I recommend the shoe for anyone with style.
