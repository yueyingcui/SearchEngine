Saucony GridÂ® Omni Walker
I have what I consider a wide foot, and have found over the years that a 7-1/2 Saucony man's athletic shoe fits me well - I like that Saucony runs a bit wide. I actually first tried this shoe in a woman's size 9 wide and the wide made it way too big, so I decided just to go back to the man's 7-1/2 -- maybe the woman's 9 regular would have worked, but I wasn't going to risk it. Very comfortable walking shoe.
I switched from the Spira Classic Walker to the Saucony Grid Omni Walker and it was a mistake. The Saucony are stiff in the soles, lacking a comfortable bend when walking. They also lack sufficient padding or thickness in the soles. The fit is a bit tight, not true to size. Comfort takes priority over style and the Saucony failed with this shoe. They look similar to the Spira but fall way short in comfort. I will go back to wearing Spira Classics.
