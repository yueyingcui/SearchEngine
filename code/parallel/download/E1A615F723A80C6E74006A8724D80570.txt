Great comfy shoes. True to size. Took about two wears to break in (blistered a bit on the first day), but that's not unusual for new shoes (for me, as I have wider than average feet) but now they are broken in they are comfy and I love wearing them. And they look great!
I am a size 11 women shoe, and I have just started to explore the amazing comfort of men's shoes.  These shoes have a great summery look and fit wider in the toes and can be tied to fit tigh tighter at the arch.  Great shoe!
Pretty cool shoes! They feel true to size. Style is great, they are well constructed. Heel counter is a bit stiff and digs into my Achilles tendon after a moderate amount of walking. We'll see if this goes away after a few weeks. Otherwise, comfort is good.
