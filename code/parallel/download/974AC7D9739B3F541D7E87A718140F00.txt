Five Ten Anasazi LV
Perfect for low volume feet - 

I try not to buy in to the marketing hype, but the "magic fingers" heel on these is fantastic.  I am a woman with very low volume feet.  I wear an 8.5 street size and tried these in both an 8 and 8.5, usually I have to downsize just to keep my heel in a shoe, but with these I was able to have solid contact in the heel of these and comfort in my toe box with an 8.5 in these.  As always Stealth C4 is sticky and the lined synthetic upper is great at controlling stretch.  I'll be resoling these for a while.
What a great shoe to have in the quiver! If you are a smaller climber and have felt that other variations of the 5.10 velcro models have been too stiff, then this is the shoe for you! Edgy without being unfeeling, securely fitting heel and the light color is a bonus for those hot summer days. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS AS A WOMEN'S SHOE!!! Though sized on the women's chart, if you are a low volume dude, you'll dig this shoe! I size "true" to my men's velcro-use the EU size—it's the easiest way to convert. Since getting this shoe, I've worn them on cracks, edges and sloper fests—my favorite application for this shoe so far is steeper, smeary climbing—but for me this shoe fits into the "softer" category as I am a bigger climber! The LV, The Anasazi Velcro, The Galileo...with these three velcro models, you've got it all covered!
