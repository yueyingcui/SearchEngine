O'Neill Surf Turkey Suede
I bought these for my husband, and after we got the right size, he loves them!  They run kind of big so opt for the smaller size if you're unsure.  They are nice looking and very warm!
These are comfortable slip ons. They fit true to size and the quality seems good for the price. My 12 year old son thinks they are cool.
