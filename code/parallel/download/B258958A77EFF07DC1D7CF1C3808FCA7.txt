Polo Ralph Lauren Vaughn
I ordered these as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved them.These shoes have a more casual look than your normal tennis shoe.He states they run true to size.
These shoes look great and fit true to size. My son wanted something comfortable that wasn't an "athletic" shoe for college. He actually has a wide foot and these are fine. These are perfect.
The sneaker is very comfortable. Other reviewers noted that the shoe ran large so I ordered a 1/2 size less than I would have for a sneaker and they fit fine.
Huge! Narrow and long I am returning them for a half size lower. I am tempted to get a full size but fear they will be too tight...wish me luck.
