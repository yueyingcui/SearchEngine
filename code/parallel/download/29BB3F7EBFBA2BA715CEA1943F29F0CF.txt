Lakai Mariano
Snazzy and Comfy... with a few flaws - 
It's a comfy shoe, but I don't know how it skates yet being that its winter. The sizing for me was kind of weird; one size was two small and the other was too big despite me going in half size increments.
These are great shoes. They felt true to size and width. They have great arch support and they look great.
