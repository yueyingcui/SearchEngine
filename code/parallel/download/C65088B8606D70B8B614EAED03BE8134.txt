New Balance WW759
Comfortable shoe - 
Very comfortable - runs a little small. I had to order the next size up.

These are very classy shoes. Very true to size and your toes are not too crowded. The color is deep purple; maybe hard to tell that it is purple from a distance. The heel is high enough to give some lift, but not too high to be uncomfortable if you need to stand for long periods of time like I do.
Good looking but poor fit - 
I bought these shoes to use with newly acquired orthotics. I called New Balance to ask if I should order a larger size. They said, "No. Order the size that you usually wear." We are going on a trip and will be doing a lot of walking so I wanted something comfortable. The PT person that made the orthotics for me suggested New Balance. My feet hurt when wearing them and I am pretty upset about it.
Great shoe!
I LOVE this shoe!! Although, I did need to order it in a 1/2 size larger. I also put a heel support in it, but that's due to the fact "I" need that kind of support, I'm sure others would not.

New Balance WW759 - 
The shoe is comfortable, but I ordered a size 9 M when I normally wear an 8 1/2 M. It runs a little small, plus the heel collar pushes the foot forward making the shoe seem shorter. Seems a little snug, but is okay with thin socks.
A great sneaker - 
I ordered these for my mom, who thought that New Balance didn't fit her because she had a wide foot... ordered the wide size, and it was perfect. They're very comfy and she loves them.
