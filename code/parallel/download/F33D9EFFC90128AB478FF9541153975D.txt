Levi's&#174; Shoes Riesel
I figured that I would review these since no one has yet. I just got these to wear with jeans. I got them in the gray color to wear with jeans. They are surprisingly high quality, and they do not look like cheap shoes. They are not really canvas. The material kind of reminds me of what backpacks are made out of (is that nylon?), which means I think that they will hold up pretty well. They definitely met my expectations. I am a size 11, and their 11 fit my feet perfectly.
