Mizuno Wave® Elixir™ 7
These running shoes are fantastic.  My last pair of running shoes was the previous version of the Mizuno Elixir 7 which I was fitted for at a running store.  I loved them so much I wanted another pair.  I typically buy my running shoes a size larger to allow space for movement in the toe area , but this shoe seems a bit larger in that area so I only needed a 1/2 size larger. I've been running for years and this is one of the best running shoes I've worn.  
I have rarely been as excited about a new shoe as I was about this one. It is very light and the toebox is huge, which may make it feel wider than normal to some, but is wonderful for someone like me who has a tendency to lose nails on longer runs. Otherwise the fit feels true to size. I usually run in a 10 (in Mizuno and Brooks) and that was the size I got for the Elixir. I've run about 50 miles in them so far and am a big fan. I also personally like the pattern. Two thumbs up.
LOVE this shoe! I have narrow heels, flat arches, a bunion on one foot and I pronate. I know, yikes! Mizuno shoes always provide a soft landing and the perfect fit for my foot issues. I tried the Wave Ascend and The Wave Inspire, but the Elixir felt the best. Light weight, breathable and very cushioned foot bed. I use my own orthotics but I think there is a decent arch support. I normally buy 1/2 size up with Mizuno but didn't this time and the fit is perfect!
Bought these shoes as they come in a size 10.5 and Mizunos often run narrow. I have a very low volume foot and these have way too much room in the toe box. They are tolerable for running, but I cannot even walk in them without almost falling over due to the excess room in the front causing instability. If you have a thick foot, these will fit fine. Good shoe if you want a transition to a minimalist shoe with decent stability and have a thick foot. Wish I could return them, but alas, one cannot tell if you like a shoe to run in until you run in it.
