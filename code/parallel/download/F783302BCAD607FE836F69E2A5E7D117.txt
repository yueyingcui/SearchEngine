inov-8 Roclite™ 275 GORE-TEX®
These are the best shoes that I have ever owned for my sport of dog agility. The moves required are kind of like basketball on grass. Lots of running with quick stops and sudden changes in direction. This barefoot hybrid is comfortable, with superb traction. Runs slightly small but i was still able to go with my normal size 9. You might want to order a half size up as well to make your decision. Other Innov-8 styles did not feel as great as these. I bought three pairs!
These shoes have a really pointy toe box. I've worn medium to narrow shoes comfortably in the past, but even after I switched to a larger size in this model, my third and fourth toes were still rubbing on the sides.

I have worn the shoes several times while working out in a "Boot Camp" class. The surface we use is grass and pavement. The shoes are very light and the cleats really help with running and cutting on grass and hills. I have so far done several runs of 1-2 miles on pavement in the shoes without any foot discomfort. I ordered my true size and the shoe fits perfectly. The quality is top notch. The GORE-TEX material is exactly what I need for wet grass surface workouts. I highly recommend the shoe for the type of workout that I am doing.
I bought the shoes a half size larger than normal and the fit is good. Waterproofing is great. I would buy these again.
