Teva Churn Evo
These are very cute shoes and I so wanted to loved them but, as another reviewer wrote, the heels were loose and slid all over the place, no matter how much I tightened the toggle. They did feel very comfortable and seemed like they would be great without socks.  They are also very light, you barely even notice they are there. They do run true to size. There is ample room in the toe box. Sadly, had to return because the loose heels caused so much discomfort.
I really wanted to like this shoe. I love the comfort of Teva sandals and was hoping to find an equally comfy shoe to use while traveling this summer. However, I could never get it to fit my foot comfortably. The heels on both shoes were loose and slipped on my heel. I used the cinch cord to try to tighten it, which worked somewhat on the heel but pressed uncomfortably on the top of my foot. I wore them around the house for a day and instead of being extremely comfy, I was conscious of the discomfort the whole time I had the shoes on. So unfortunately they're going back. They look great and actually make my size 9.5 feet look smaller than they are!
I love this shoe!  It was purchased post surgery 1/2 size bigger than usual; and it's perfect.  It has lots of room in the toe box.  It's light, very light.  I wore it on the plane and hiking through the airport.  I have no doubt I will find many uses for this shoe now and in the future.  When all the swelling is down I'll just order down.
Cute shoe, great fit, true to size.  But wanted these for kayaking, and thought the open areas along the sides of the shoe and the heel would allow sand/small rocks to enter.  And that's a pain, when your feet are trapped inside the boat! Would be great for running around on land.  But these are going back. 
What a neat shoe this is! I purchased these to take on a cruise. They're colorful, lightweight, comfortable and true to size, plus a two day delivery. Wow!
