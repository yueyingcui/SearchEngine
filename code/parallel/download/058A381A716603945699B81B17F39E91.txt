Nike Free Run+ 2
I'm very sorry to write this but, I'm very unhappy with my order. After using my pair of shoes I found that they hurt my pinky finger as well as they rubber my hill to the point that both of my hills are sensitive to even any closed shoes. I had to buy hill's support and used band aids in order to wear them.I got one pair for my mother and she complains of the same problem. I will like to send them back and get the correct size or better quality shoe.
After a lot of research, I switched to the Free Run 2.0 from my usual rigid New Balance walking shoe. So far, so good. The shoe fits like a glove, provides enough support, and the natural foot motion feels good. I like that the back of the shoe is low and soft and does not gouge into my heel or ankle. No shin strain yet, and my touchy Achilles tendon and bad knee feel good. I ordered a full size up, and the width and placement of the arch support are good. (The shoe is flattering to big feet!)
Just got these shoes today (less than 24 hours after ordering them!) and they are wonderful! I've been searching for shoes to replace my Merrells for the last 3 months and have gone through probably 12 pairs in my search for comfortable, minimalist and half way decent looking shoes. These fit the bill! At the suggestion of other reviewers, I ordered a 1/2 size larger and they seem to fit well. The toe is quite a bit pointer than shoes I'm used to but it provides great wiggle room without rubbing. Definitely recommend these!
Definitely order a half size larger. This is the second pair of this style for my daughter, and the size 11 was a touch too big so we ordered the 10.5. Definitely too small so we exchanged. My daughter loves these shoes. As a collegiate athlete, she uses them for workouts and running, the first pair we bought December 2011, and she wore them every day. They lasted 6 months, which is good for the amount of abuse they got.
