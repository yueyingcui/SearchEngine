SKECHERS KIDS Mighty Flex  95260L (Toddler/Youth)
Great shoe, very light and easy to find.  The sole is bright! I will buy them in the next size. 
These shoes are great for my 5yr old. It's nice that they offer half sizes and they are true to size. They are very light weight and wash well. He thinks he's super cool. :)
