Nike Kids Cortez Leather (Infant/Toddler)
I love these! I wear them myself, but these kid size ones are so cute I got them for my son. Love the classics.
Cutest thing ever! The weight and size are very good. My baby has rather chubby dorsals and yet it fit perfectly. He is walking now for about two months and he walks very well with this one (he tumbles with some other shoes).
This is a very light shoe and durable for your little one. I bought a different brand, size 3, and that shoe was heavy for my baby. I wish I had not wasted my money, babies need light shoes.
