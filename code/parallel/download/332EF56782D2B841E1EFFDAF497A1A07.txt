UGG Evera
These shoes are so comfortable I wish I could wear them to the office instead of heels everyday. They are a great shoe to run errands in all day and keep your feet nice and warm in the cold weather. I usually wear a 7.5, I ordered both a 7.5 and an 8 and I didn't notice much of a difference in the sizes. 
I guess I'm the only person who thought these shoes ran 1/2 size smaller? I always wear a 5.5, and even with sneakers I wear this size with thin socks. However, these were at least a 1/2 size smaller, maybe more (have to see after I re-order the next size up). Otherwise, they are super cute, comfortable, and the insole is very cushy!
I am not one of those people who can walk all day in shoes that have no support. But of course, I prefer the looks of many no-support shoes. Based on other reviews this looked like it might be a shoe that looked good and performed well. And for me, it is! I've worn them a couple of times for all day shopping and sight-seeing, and my feet and legs felt great. My toes all line up, no nice slant to the front of my foot, resulting in a need for a decent sized toe box. These fit that bill as well!
