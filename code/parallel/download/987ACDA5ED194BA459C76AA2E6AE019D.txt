PUMA Roma Basic Wn's
I LOVE these shoes!!! They are light,  comfortable and true to size. I'd definitely recommend them!  
It's a basic sneaker. I wear this one to work because it's pretty average. I got it because I love the colors but in a size 9 it does seem a bit orthopedic looking. I loosened the laces considerably as my foot is pretty wide and they fit a little tight at first. Maybe the loosening of the laces is was made it look orthopedic...overall it serves it's purpose and works well for me. The colors keep me happy.
