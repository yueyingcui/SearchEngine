Levi's&#174; Kids Zip Ex Hi Ct Twill (Youth)
I purchased these Levi's high top shoes for my almost 11 years old son (he wants to wear only high top). He likes it and they look very stylish with jeans, but not with shorts. I can't tell you if they are larger, wider or anything else, because it's not possible to find out, but if my son said "Yes, I'll wear it," they are okay with size. Definitely recommend it.
