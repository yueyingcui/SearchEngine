Morgan&Milo Kids LTT Slip-On Skinny (Toddler/Youth)
We have bought these for 2 years now and just bought all colors in the next size up because my son LOVES them! The tongue is only hard for the first few days then it loosens up perfectly! We have gone threw 6 pairs in this style and have never had a blister or a complaint! He lives in these! They wear beautifully and look great with everything!
