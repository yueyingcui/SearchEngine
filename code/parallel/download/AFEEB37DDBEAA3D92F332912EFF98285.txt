Elephantito Moccasin (Infant)
These could not have been cuter. They do fall off, however, and he kicked them off. They worked for the short time we used them. If he needed to wear these all day, I would probably switch to a velcro shoe. Maybe they would have fallen off less if he had a less slippery sock? He is 7 months old and I think his foot is on the smaller side; the size 2 seemed to fit well. Since they're absolutely adorable, I would buy them again for our short function.
