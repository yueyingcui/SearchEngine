Tsukihoshi Kids Flash (Toddler)
Awesome back to school shoes for my little guy. This is the second pair of Tsukihoshi tennis shoes we've bought for him. You can't beat their quality construction and design. They're a little expensive but they're worth every penny because they will last all season long and they wash extremely well. We always order a half size smaller than his actual foot size because they run large. Great shoe!
