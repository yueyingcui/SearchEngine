Puma Kids GV Special Jr (Toddler/Youth)
These are awesome. Order half-a-size or a full size up. I usually order a full size up for the kids (growing) and 1/2 a size for myself. Style cannot be beat and price wasn't bad. I have been wearing this style and buying it for my children as well as for myself, for over 10 years. Recommended. A+.
