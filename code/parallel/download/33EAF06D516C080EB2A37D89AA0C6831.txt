Converse Kids Chuck Taylor® All Star® Easy Slip (Infant/Toddler)
Great shoes, easy on and off. My 3 year old son can put them on himself. They do run big but I just ordered a size and planned for that. And there's nothing more classic than a high-top Chuck!
Love the shoes! My son saw them and wanted to put them on immediately. Converse are classics. Sturdy and fashionably cute. Runs large for size.
