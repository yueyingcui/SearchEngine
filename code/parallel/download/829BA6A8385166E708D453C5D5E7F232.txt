New Balance M730v1
I recently started walking 30 minutes a day on a new treadmill I purchased to get back into shape. I had a pair of NB All Terrains, but they didn't feel right on a treadmill. After a bit of research I choose these shoes and have been completely happy with them. They fit my wide feet like a glove. The fit is excellent and true to size. They are very light and comfortable. I plan on buying additional pairs in other colors. After two months, I now average 30-60 minutes on the treadmill every day.
I bought these because NB updated the MT20 from v1 to v2. The v1 was extremely comfy for me with a wide foot and made me realize how horribly uncomfortable my shoes have been since Vans became uncomfortable in early 2000s. The M730v1 in size 11.5 2E fit almost as nicely as the MT20v1 in 11.5 2E. Before owning both pairs of these shoes, I hadn't worn 11.5 since middle school. The M730v1 is not quite as wide of a footbed at the midsole area and somewhat compresses the center of my foot. Bring back the New Balance MT20v1!
Awesome and light. Great for hanging out. But they run small. Add at least 1/2 size.
I have 2 other pairs of New Balance running shoes which are size 9. I had to return these for a size 8, which fits perfectly with room to breath. These run large.
