K-Swiss Kids Tubesâ„¢ Run 100 Mesh (Toddler/Youth)
My son suffers with very low arches, and therefore achilles and shin problems when running, walking and hiking for prolonged time (a mile!). He is only 9. This is pretty sad for a kid. We have struggled finding something that doesn't "hurt" when he walks around in it. This fits the bill. He was wearing Geox before, but these are wonderful for him. They give cushioning and support, but not so much support that they are too stiff. He does not get shin splints because of the shoe (very important to us). He does wear a Dr. Scholls womens 3/4 insert for a little more arch support, per the doctor. The shoe runs true to size. Hope this helps.
