Sperry Top-Sider Mako 2-Eye Canoe Moc
These are great boat shoes. I picked them up at the Sperry Store at my local mall. One thing to keep in mind...these run about 1/2 to a full size larger compared to your normal 'dress' shoe. The rep at the store said the Mako style, in particular, was known to run big. I wear a 9 dress shoe, 9.5 sneaker and I ended up getting a size 8 in these Sperry shoes. Once you get the fit right, they are very comfortable, though they definitely need to be broken in to get that annoying 'shine' off of them.
Very nice looking shoe. I've had Sperry before...sadly they were very small and I even bought the EE. Going to try to get larger size and width and see how that goes. Returning today.
These are comfortable right out of the box and they are not stiff, unlike most boat shoes made of leather. They have a classy look, nice weight, and are true to size. Overall, these are highly recommended.
These shoes are fantastic! Picture (I bought brown) very accurate, shoes extremely comfortable. I wear them boating and they are perfect. Like them better than the standard topsiders because they have a little more cushion. They definitely stretch a bit, so you may want to try 1/2 size smaller (I didn't, and they are still fine).
Ordered these shoes about 4 weeks ago in size 11. They were a little to tight, so exchanged them for a saixe 11.5. No problem getting the new shoes. I sent the others back without a  shipping charge. I'm happy with the shoes. Wish I would have kept the size 11's though.
True to size. The leather feels a bit stiff when first put them on. They took a couple days to stretch so that they fit better. Now they are comfortable and I wear them 5 days/week. I would recommend these to anyone.
It is difficult to find a narrow size 13 shoe but Sperry continues to make shoes that fit me.  My only complaint is that the shoe seems to rub my ankle.  That may cease to be an issue after I wear the shoes for a while.
