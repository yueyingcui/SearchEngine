Montrail Rogue Racerâ„¢
I really like these shoes. I ordered a half size larger as suggested and it was perfect. The free shipping was nice, although it was ground shipping and took longer than I am used to waiting. However, it was shipped promptly and was exactly what I wanted so. The arch support is nice because it is only inside the shoe (the sole doesn't arch with it), which is nice when running over bumpy terrain or balancing on fallen trees and such.
