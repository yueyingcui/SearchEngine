Mizuno WaveÂ® Ascend 7
I love Mizuno shoes to run in. I over pronate and tried Nikes and they killed my feet. Mizuno's usually last 6 months for the amount of running I do and so far no other shoes have lasted as long. I highly recommend them and I love the design too. I usually wear a size 7.5 but for running I always go a size bigger.
