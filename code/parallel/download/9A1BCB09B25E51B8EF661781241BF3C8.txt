New Balance Kids KJ814 (Toddler/Youth)
My grandson loves them. The extra wide size fit great, and they look good. He just learned to tie, so he's extra proud to have great fitting shoes that he can tie, no need for the Velcro. I would order another pair in different color if available.
They are great, true to size, and a great quality.
Expensive for a lower quality kids shoe. The "extra wide" size adds more depth, but they're not really very wide at all. So if you have very wide feet, they will push the sides of the shoe out over the soles.

I'm very happy with these shoes. Lightweight but sturdy (the side and top material seem very "breathable") The pull-tab on the back makes them so easy to get my 3 year old's foot in. He also loves walking in them so know they're comfortable too. Very true to size. Width may be just a tad more narrow than expected, I ordered an XW in place of W and worked out perfectly. Great shoe.
