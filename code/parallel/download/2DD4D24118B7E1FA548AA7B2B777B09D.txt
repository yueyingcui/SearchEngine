ECCO Chase Tie
I needed a casual walking shoe for Europe and I tried at least a dozen different pair. When I read the review on this pair, I ordered them in my size 7 (size was 7/7-1/2). Although they were comfy, they were too big. So I ordered down one size and - Bingo! They even fit my orthotics. I've been breaking them in with no problems - just a slight rub on one heel. Cute and comfortable - I'm thinking about buying the brown pair.
Bought these shoes for a trip to Pisa, Italy where we rented an apartment for 4 days just a few weeks ago. Brought them over brand new, without breaking them in at home first...and held my breath. They were fantastic for the 4 days of heavy pounding they got. Continued to wear them afterward in every small hill town on Tuscany. Really amazing how comfortable they are, especially as I have a modest sized bunion (ugh) on my right foot. These are must-have shoes for stone pavements. Looked okay, too, with a casual khaki skirt.
I love these shoes. They are comfortable with good support. I love the red color. I ordered my usual size 7 and they are a great fit. I would recommend these to anyone who walks a lot or just likes comfort.
I really like these shoes. The leather is beautiful in this color. They are stylish and comfortable. I normally wear a size 7.5 and the 38 fits me perfect. Very happy customer.
