New Balance Classics ML574
Overall, I like these shoes a lot. They're reasonably comfortable, stylish and won't break the bank. My only complaint is that the shoes are not as wide as I expected them to be, even though I ordered them specifically for that reason. I have wide feet (duck feet, as my wife so affectionately calls them). Overall, I am mostly happy with the purchase. They are much more comfortable and fit my feet much better than a regular sized shoe would.
My son's favorite color ORANGE. He likes to be seen. Shipped very quickly. Product is very well made, even the laces are heavy duty. Should last the school year. Great fit, He ordered size 13 wide, and the fit is perfect.
Awesome shoes. Love the dark red and they're very comfortable and not tight anymore after break-in. I'm very picky about my size and these broke-in perfectly; best fit I've had so far. Running in them is great (just don't go hiking over rocks, you'll slip easy!). They seem to be very high quality and durable; the material seems to mold to the shape of my foot which makes these shoes the best I've had (reminds me of a temperpedic sleep mattress)!
My first pair of New Balance... they feel great and look nice. Seems a sturdy build. Picked 1/2 a size smaller my usual size seemed too big.. smaller size feels a little snug but comfortable. I'd rather break in a snug fit than deal with a loose shoe. Comfortable to walk in! 

The bend at the toe of these shoes some what bothers me and the shoe feels a little bigger than the actual size. I have to have them laced tight in order for these shoes to not slip off my feet when walking.
