Drew Force Velcro&reg;
I had problems with the sizing of these shoes, but when I finally got the right size I found them perfect for exercise, daily wear and even dress. Unlike other brands, their Velcro straps are wide and long, so the Velcro, which inevitably collects lint, is not exposed when the shoe is worn.
I have always had a difficult time trying to find good shoes that are wide enough for my feet and the orthotic that I wear. I've ordered the widest sizes in other brands and they still didn't fit. I originally ordered a 6E in this style which turned out to be too wide! The 4E fit perfectly. They are also very high quality. They are a bit on the heavy side but overall I am very pleased with them.
I am diabetic and found them better than the special made shoes. I have wide feet and high arches and your first salesperson told to half size. Which I did and I am on my fourth pair. The next day service is great.
Sole wears down in 5 months and mis-sized. This shoe is so much wider than any 6E width we've tried. Although it does fit over a full sized orthotic, the foot without an orthotic needed a custom insert and double socks and still slides. Also, the toe end of the sole has worn down completely, unlike any other shoe this man has worn, and it's only been 5 months since purchase.
Good but could be better - 
Much wider than actual size...was not aware I could not walk outside with them...now I can't return them. Feel stuck with an expensive shoe I canâ€™t wear.
