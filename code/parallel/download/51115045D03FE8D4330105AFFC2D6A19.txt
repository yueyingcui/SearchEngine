Converse Kids Chuck Taylor® All Star® Loop-2-Knot Slip (Toddler/Youth)
The shoes are a terrible design. Didn't experience what others are saying about the laces, but only because my daughter couldn't get them on. We tried 3 different sizes and the opening was so small she couldn't even get her foot into the shoe. We wanted to love these because they are really a cool looking, but when I went 3 sizes up from her normal size and she still couldn't get her foot through the hole we gave up. Boner move, Converse.
These are adorable in person. They run narrow, unfortunately for my child, but they are so cute. Also, when it says Youth size, it might be clearer to say equivalent to men's sizes. I ordered a 5 and it almost fit me...I wear a men's 6 in Converse.
