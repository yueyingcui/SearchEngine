OluKai Makapu U
One problem - the backs are too high and stiff. These shoes keep rubbing my Achilles tendons raw. (I am wearing with socks.) I keep wanting them to work because the soles are about the most comfy thing I have ever worn, but they definitely need some breaking-in time to get past my problem. People mentioned these shoes being too big in some reviews so I followed their advice and got a 1/2 size smaller than usual - bad advice. Get your size.
Great shoe and style! Shoe is true to size. I would suggest trying them on in a conventional store, as other Olukai's I've had have run about a half size big.
