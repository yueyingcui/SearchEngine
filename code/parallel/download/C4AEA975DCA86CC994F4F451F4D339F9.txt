PUMA Roma Basic
My feet are on the narrow side so these felt fine in terms of width. They did feel a little shorter than other size 13 shoes that I own. But they are still comfortable.
Normally I wear a 14, a 15 on rare occasions. And this 15 fit me tighter than most 14s would. Seemed a full size smaller. Otherwise seems like a nice, stylish shoe. I'd recommend ordering a size larger, at least in the larger sizes.
