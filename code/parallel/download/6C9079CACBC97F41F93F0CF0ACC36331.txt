SKECHERS KIDS Bella Ballerina - Prima Bella Reena (Toddler/Youth)
We'll order the next size up for our 7 year old. We know she has a wide foot. Hope you have the size, she loves it!
I bought these for my 6 year old.  She loves them!  She has been twirling all over the place.  Got half size bigger due to other reviews.
Very cute shoes.  Bought these as a Christmas present for my 5 yo and she likes them, except that she finds them a bit tight so they must run a bit smaller in size.  Try ordering 1 size larger for better results.
My 6.5 year old granddaughter loves these! They are cute, fit to size and appeal to her interests in dance. She adores the "spin" like a ballerina element. Bravo Skechers!
