Ryka optimum mary jane 2
I really love these shoes, but the velcro fastener is not extensive enough, and occasionally pops open. Once I exchanged them for a size larger, they fit perfectly.
Great shoes. Glad I read the reviews and ordered a size larger. 

It is exactly what I wanted. Comfortable. After reading reviews, I bought a size larger than I would normally, and it fits fine.
Very uncomfortable. I love my Ryka running shoes. But even though these are the same size, this model doesn't fit my foot correctly. No matter how I adjusted the velcro closure there was pressure on the inside of the ball of my foot & it rubbed with every step. I had to return them.
Everyone, important! This model runs very short. I had to get a full size larger. I owned about 8 pairs of Ryka shoes before, always wore size 7, but had to get size 8 for these shoes. Other than that - perfect, just like all Ryka shoes. I am giving 4 stars for the difference in sizing.
This is a darling shoe but ran extremely small, at least for me.  I usually wear an 11.5 which is exceptionally hard to find, so frequently I order a size 12.  This 12 felt like an 11, so much so that I actually looked inside each shoe to check the size.  
These shoes don't seem to have as much cushioning as the former "Versa" style of this shoe. Also, runs a half size small.
This shoe is not true to size or even close. It appears to be at least 2 sizes too small.
This shoe looks bulky, but it’s a very reliable shoe in terms of comfort, especially if you’re going on a trip. I ordered size 8 1/2 and the fit was perfect.
