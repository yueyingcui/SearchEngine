PUMA Mostro - Mesh
Nice shoe, but there seems a disparity between the airy mesh upper and the thick plastic/rubber sole. While the upper/top of the shoe gets good ventilation and keeps quite cool, this makes the bottom of the foot feel, by contrast, that much warmer and stuffy. Also, the Velcro straps fasten on the inside of the foot, which seem impractical, as they tend to become unfastened quite frequently from the natural movement of the opposite foot hitting the fastener while swinging forward. The mesh material used for the upper, while allowing good airflow, is quite stretchy, which leaves the shoe feeling a bit loose and unsteady, even though it is already half a size smaller (in length and width) than my foot. But since the shoes are light, I never felt in fear of them falling off.
They are really comfortable but run small! I am a size 10, and don't make my feet look huge.
Really comfortable and good looking shoe for walking around; all day wear. Runs small and tight.I'd advise sizing up at least a half-size from your dress shoe size, unless your foot is very narrow.
