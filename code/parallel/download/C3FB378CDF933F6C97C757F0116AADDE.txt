Reebok RealFlex Optimal W
Love, love, love these shoes! I use them first and foremost for Zumba but also for elliptical and treadmill. They are very lightweight, yet supportive and super flexible - which comes in handy when showing off my sassy Zumba moves! My only caution is on the sizing. I am usually a 7.5 and have a wide-ish foot with a very high instep. Every once in a great while I wear a size 7 when the shoe is a flip-flop or open sandal. In the RealFlex I am a very comfortable size 6.5! I typically wear them barefoot or with extremely thin socks.

I never thought that I had wide feet until I got these shoes. they feel really tight, but when  got the next half size up, the arch hit my foot in the wrong place. I wish they offered wide sizes.  Also, I wish the sole was pink and not wight because it would look nicer since white always appears dirtier and would work with the color scheme better.
