Tretorn Nylite Canvas
Not quite as undersized as Puma's...but if you normally where a size 13 you should order a 14. Also, fits wider than Adidas and Puma.
The quality of these shoes was decent. However the size 10Â½ that I ordered was half to a whole size too small.
I usually wear a size 10.5. I ordered an 11.5 according to a review stating they run really small. They were a size too big. Order to your normal size.

I recently bought a pair of these and was really surprised by the comfort, almost like wearing a slipper with more cushioning. I agree that they are not meant for serious sports but as a basic sneaker for walking it's an excellent shoe. It does run a size small though. I'm usually 10.5 and I needed an 11.5
My first pair of Tretorns...very light, very comfy. I like these shoes a lot; and they fit true to size. I'm an average (D) width, and I look forward to enjoying these shoes this spring. Very comfy (did I already say that?). I highly recommend these shoes.
Wide selection of shoes. One of few places to find small size shoes for men. Excellent service.
