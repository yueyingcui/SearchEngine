Keen Gypsum
Did not fit. Were a size smaller than the shoe stated. Have other shoes 9.5 size and all fit. This did not fit, what a waste.
These fit true to size. They a little high than a hiking shoe and may offer more support on longer trails. Time will tell. 
These feel like Keens should feel, although it took moving up a size to do it. Super comfy right out of the box. 
Another great Keen product. I bought these for hiking in Maine and they did not disappoint. Great flex and support, and great grip. We were descending on wet granite slabs and these stuck like glue. Perfect for warm weather hiking. I happen to love the grey and green too! Oh by the way, if you have any other Keens order that size. I ordered a size bigger based on other reviews and had to send them back for my regular size. I find Keens true to traditional sizes anyway.
I have been using my Keen Targhees (or similar) since 2007 and thought it was time for a new pair. These have the same wide toebox, but come up a bit higher on the heel/ankle and rub uncomfortably on the bone. Just like everyone says, they are half a size small. I wear a 7Â½ and ordered an 8; the length fit great.
Great color combination. Sturdy and solid shoe. Order a half size more (example: I ordered 8 1/2 and need a 9). All around great shoe!
