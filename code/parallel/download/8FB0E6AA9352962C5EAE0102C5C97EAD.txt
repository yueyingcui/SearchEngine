SKECHERS Energy
For someone who doesn't wear sneakers (because of their look - I'm a boot person) I truly love these! I bought a pair a couple years ago just in case I ever need sneakers. Picky about style and price (and a Skechers fan) I chose "Skechers Energy." They are a very comfortable sneaker, not to mention nice looking for a sneaker. The fit is true to size. Again, the comfort and style are A+. I highly recommend this shoe!
Seems to run a little short. Other than that, I like it so I'm requesting a replacement in a size larger.
I decided to try Skechers after a recommendation from a friend. I love these shoes! I'm a plus size girl and these shoes offer tons of support and don't make my feet look huge like other walking/exercise shoes. Lightweight, durable and fashionable, these are my first Skechers and they won't be my last!
I wear them for work, and I\'m outdoors all day. They are true to size, great cushion in heel. I would order them again.
GREAT LOOKING, GREAT PRICE, GREAT COMFORT!!!!
Before I start bragging on this shoe, I would like to tell everyone that ZAPPOS has the best customer service on the entire Planet!! So why buy your shoes anywhere else!!!! Sketchers have the best quality shoes at a great price. I had a pair of Sketchers in the past and really enjoyed them. Moving on to better shoes (or at least I thought I was) I started to buy Nike 360 air for $150 & for a time tried the MBT sport shoes $260. I have to say I like my Sketchers much better. I really like the fact that they give you a little height. I do not wear tennis shoes a lot although I am a big fan of boots and MBT sport sandals. In reading the reviews I decided to purchase the Sketchers in my normal size and they were a bit too tight with a thick sport sock, I returned them for n 8 ½ and they fit perfect. So I would suggest ordering a ½ size bigger if you are going to where them with socks. Great shoes!!!
