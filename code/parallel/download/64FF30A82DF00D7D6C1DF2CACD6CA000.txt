Vans SK8-Hiâ„¢
If you've never owned Vans before, know they run small. Order a half size or even a full size larger than you would normally do. As far as the look, how cool is that. I think way.
Love these Vans. I have never worn Vans before, but now I love it. Very stylish with skinny jeans. I wear it at work, on leisure, everywhere. True that the size is bigger than your usual size. Size 7 feels like 7 1/2, but I will keep the 7 because I usually use an insole.
This shoe is unbeatable. It is comfortable and very stylish. When you're ordering sizes it is about a half size larger than what you put so be careful and get the right size.
