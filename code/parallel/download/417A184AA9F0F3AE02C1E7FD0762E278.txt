Giro Carbide
After trying on several womens and mens cycling shoes, in all brands and sizes, I finally ended up with these in a size 43.5 for my ladies street size 10.5 - 11, normal width feet. They are a bit wide, but they are mens shoes. With the velcro straps as tight as they can go, these provide a snug fit. I have a little toe wiggle room at the end. They are just boring black cycling shoes, so I can't really say much for the style. But I am happy with these for the price and they are working well for my spin class.
