Brooks T7 Racer
Bought these shoes for the looks and I needed a light weight shoe. I used to wear racing flats when I did road racing and the feel was similar. I do a bit of trail running with these, and because of the dirt and the fact that they are white, I find myself hosing them off quite a bit (daily) and they have gotten really small for my feet. Since they were unisex, I went with the suggested size, but when I reorder, I will go a full size bigger. Love Brooks Shoes.
These did not work for me... I really wanted them to. I did order a size up but it didn't matter. I think they run at least 1.5 sizes too small. Not only do they run extremely small, but they are narrow as well.

Difficult to order as the description read 5.5/7.0 with no other specifics if it was for a man or a woman. Ended up ordering size 7.0 for a woman and it was really a man's size 5.5. It was a Christmas gift and had to be returned, which presented another problem since the person was in town just for the holidays and returned to a different state.
These are great fun and comfortable, but not my first choice for running. I love the offset laces and the subtle metallic thread in them. Be sure to order these a size up because they run small!
I really like my new shoes, but the prior reviews were right, please order 1 to 1.5 sizes larger because this shoe runs very small. I ordered 1 size larger & they fit snug with no discomfort. I wear an average thick sock when I run. If you wear very thick socks, please consider that when placing your order.
Shoe felt great and light, can't wait to try it. But they run small (compared to Adidas), so I'll have to return it for at least one size up before I can try it out.
These are light and comfortable - but they run very small, order at least a 1/2 size larger.
