Bloch Traverse Mid
I always buy an exercise shoe 1/2 size larger than my normal size.  I did the same with the Bloch
Traverse Mid and it was still much too small.  This shoe needs to be ordered at least one full size larger.
Very cute, flexible shoe, with a sweet spin spot for Zumba.  Fit was really small I needed a  full size larger then I take for street wear, also felt narrower than average.  If you need good arch support this shoe won't provide it.  Be ready for for the great comments on the style.
Love these...very comfortable and light for dancing. With Bloch I always buy 1 or 1 and a half sizes bigger than my regular shoe size.
