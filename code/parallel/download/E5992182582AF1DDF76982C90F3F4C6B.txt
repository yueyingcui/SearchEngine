Lakai Manchester Select
These sneakers are so freaking cool. Their bright, vivid color refreshes me deeply. It's hard to have a blah day when you wear these. Now, to more mundane aspects: these shoes are very snug -- not because I bought the wrong size, but because they're just highly supportive. They seem engineered for skateboarding performance and durability. Although they are on the beefy side in terms of uppers and soles, they still afford great feel and control when skating. So, to sum: if you like drab colors and a loose, light shoe, don't get these. If you want something vivid and substantial that actively grips your feet from every side, providing terrific support for all kinds of activity including skating, you will probably love these.
I found the website easy to navigate and to place my order. The shoes arrived as expected in the size and color I ordered...couldn't be happier!
I ordered these shoes for my 26 year old son, he perused long and hard and chose this color.  They look great and are comfortable.  He has ordered this brand before and they run true to size and are very sporty and clean looking in a colorful way.
Great shoe. This is the second pair I've bought and know it won't be my last. I wore my last pair into the ground which took me quite a while. I've also paid a lot more for shoes that don't last as long as these. So for the money, they're a great buy. So if you're in the market for a skate shoe, I'd recommend giving these a shot. Not bad! I've also found them true to size, so you shouldn't have to worry about ordering a size up or anything like that.
