SKECHERS Odesa - Goredo
Runs very small, at least a half size, maybe a full size. I agree with other reviewers that it has little or no support. I can't tell if the support is a problem because I was unable to wear the shoe for a full day because of the size.
These are great shoes. I love them. They are light and look great. They do have poor support, but that is to be expected from shoes that are this light and flexible. The poor support does not make them uncomfortable, all the contrary. I can walk all day and my feet are still happy. Run a full size short. 
Cool shoe but runs very small. I would suggest ordering at least a half size larger. I wear a 10 1/2 to 11 but could use an 11 in this style.
