adidas Kids Boat Lace (Toddler/Youth)
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these shoes. I bought these for my child size but 36 year old foot. Super cute and fun, these brightly colored blue shoes have great colored contrast and are comfortable. I even use these shoes for wakeskating.
My sneaker loving 9 year old son is very happy with these. Very lightweight, comfortable & rugged enough for the summer. Does run small though. Normally a size 1 he is wearing a size 2 in these. We ordered both sizes based on the other feedback and returned the size 1 pair.
