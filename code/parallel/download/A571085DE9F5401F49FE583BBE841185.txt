Converse Work Key Player
These are great safety shoes. They meet all the ratings, aren't too heavy, and are comfortable to wear all day. True to size and will also accommodate thick socks. Great job by Converse on these.
I needed a pair of steel toe boots after I broke my toe helping my husband in the yard. I ordered these in my size and one up, along with Keens that were similar. I tried the Keens on, and felt they were fine. Then I tried the Converse on and did not take them off all day! I did not need them, but they were so comfortable and cute, I could not help myself! They are supportive, but not too much so. They are cool to work outside in, but also cool enough to wear anywhere fashion is an interest. Honestly they are some of the best shoes I have tried on in years! I am so glad that I bought them!
I was expecting these to be a bit smaller so I bought a larger size. Don't! They are very true to size, wider then expected which is good for me. I would recommend a nice insert for support. Over all I do like them very much.

Wore them a few weeks. Like the style, lite weight. Size seems to run smaller. NO markings on shoes to state true size, just on the box. Can't return them because they were worn. Had to put in new arch supports. Have to spend another price for a larger size.
