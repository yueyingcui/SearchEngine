Supra Skytop
I order these shoes in 9.5 but I think you guys made mistake and sent me them in size 10. I'm a send the size 10 tomorrow morning back. When would I get the size 9.5? I need it by next week Thursday is my friends birthday.
Ordered the black stealth brilliant. The material could be a little more durable, but these are very comfortable. Next ones I get will be the purple vaiders. Maybe a half size larger than I'm used to, but still OK. I also might get some TK societies. Supra makes great shoes, not just for skating.
