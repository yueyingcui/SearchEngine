Bass Buchanon
I was so looking forward to this for a new saddle shoe. I ordered the 9.5, my standard size. It was way too big and noticeably bigger (.25-.5 inch longer measured) than my other Bass 9.5 saddle shoe. I ordered a 9, and it was too small, tight around the toes, and too short. Disappointing. 

Husband said the fit was true to size and that they were comfortable with minimal breaking in.  He\'s now a Zappo\'s convert!
