Keen Kids Gypsum (Toddler/Youth)
Great shoes -- similar to previous pair my son had (a previous model), and we just wanted the same thing in his new size. Hard to know what a 22-month-old thinks, but he doesn't mind them and they're easy to put on, sturdy, etc. Wish the colors were brighter, but that's not so important. I like the wide toe box. When will shoe designers start making shoes for real feet, which are always wider at the toes than the shoes?
Bought these for my 4 year old for hiking/camping and everyday play. She finds them comfy so far. I thought they were cuter in person than in the photos on-line. We've been very happy so far with all the Keen shoes purchased for our family. This shoe seemed to run pretty true to size as well.
Super cute shoe and I think it will be, like all other Keen shoes my family has owned, fabulous! This does seem to run about  1/2 size to maybe even 1 size small. My daughter has a pair of Whispers in 10 with 1/4-1/2 inch of room in the toe but will need an 11 in these.
