New Balance Kids KX416 (Toddler/Youth)
My daughter does not wear sneakers a lot. However, she finds these to fit true to size and they are comfortable. She also really likes the style. She just turned 10 and loves the color combination. They seem well made to me too.
My 8 years daughter wears them and enjoys their comfort and design. They are also true to size.
Much nicer in person, loved the little hearts on the shoe but it does run very small and narrow. My daughter usually wears a 13 but the 13 in this shoe was way too small. I would say order 1/2 size or 1 size up.
I absolutely love these shoes! I have been wearing the white 623 with Velcro straps for five years. I needed a change with some color and these shoes were it! I have to have the extra wide width. They are fun, supportive and great sneakers. There are little hearts in the print, so girls only or toddler boys. I wear a 2XW. Now, what can I do to encourage you to put a Velcro strap on these? I am an adult with small feet and I have a hard time tying the shoes after one hip replacement. Add the Velcro in a size 2XW and I will sample it for you!
My daughter loves these shoes!  They fit great and are a nice style for wearing to school on gym days.  They seem true to size and the quality is outstanding.
My son has extra wide feet and is so hard to fit, but he loved these right out of the box.  Thank goodness for NB's extra wide sizes!
