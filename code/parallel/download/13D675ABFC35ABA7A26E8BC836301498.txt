Osiris NYC83 Slim
I love the brand Osiris, and I have over seven pairs. They are very eye catchy and they hold up better than DCs. So if you are a female boarder I advise these. But go for half a size up because they run small.
I only like one of the colours that go with these shoes but I have very wide feet and I have long feet too so I picked size 8.5 so these are the best shoes I ever had I love the comfort and the style and overall I would give it a 8.5, but the point is there comfy and I like them.
