Keds Champion-Leather Slip-On
These are a throw back to my junior high/high school years when I wore these all the time. White tennis shoes have a place in the wardrobe, but most are hard to keep clean. That's what's so great about Keds leather. These are pretty comfortable, but not right out of the box. I had to wear them around the house with socks to stretch them a bit and now they are fine. They run pretty narrow.  Wide width? Don't waste your time. Not as cushy as they used to be either, but not bad. I wear a size 7M in everything. Keds run long, so go down a half size for proper fit. I like the slip-on ease, so I'm keeping them.
I am usually size 5.5, sometimes 6. My feet are narrow. I tried both 5 and 5.5 in this one. 5 is a perfect fit for me. So I think this style is long and narrow. The shoe is very comfortable and requires no break time. I wore it to in the first time for 7-8 hours! If it has other colors, I will buy again!
This is a comfortable, classic shoe that looks good with most any sporty
outfit you choose. The comfort factor is the most important reason I buy these every spring; the other reason is the washability. I keep the new ones for daily use  when I want to look neat and fresh; I use the
previous season's shoe for
gardening or any other messy job, and throw them in the machine.
They do run a little larger than usual: I wear a 9 and had to go down 1/2 size to an 8 1/2. 
I ordered these in a size 8Â½ wide. They were too wide and too long. I love the style so I will try a smaller size.
