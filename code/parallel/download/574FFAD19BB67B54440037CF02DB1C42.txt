Circa 50 Classic
I have mixed feelings about the Circa 50 Classic. The shoe looks great. I feel that it's better looking than the Vans Authentic all around, but the problems lie in the comfort realm. Walking long distances in this shoe probably isn't a wise choice. You'd think that Circa being a skateboarding brand would strive heavily toward comfort, well they fell short on this one. Perhaps it has to do with the shoe not being true to size (mine felt a half size small, which I didn't realize until after I started walking around outside with them) and the support isn't very good. If you believe that bunions, corns, and blisters are sexy, then get down with the Circa 50 Classic. This shoe looks marvelous, but feels next to awful.
