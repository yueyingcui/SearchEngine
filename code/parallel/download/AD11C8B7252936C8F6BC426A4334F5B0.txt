Geox Kids Jr New Jocker Girl FW11 Lighted (Toddler/Youth)
These sneakers are great. They have just enough sparkle, but it isn't distracting or garish. They fit true to size and the toe box is decently wide. My daughter has a boxy foot and needs shoes that open large enough to accommodate the height of her foot. I will definitely spend money on Geox in the future- these are well worth the price.
