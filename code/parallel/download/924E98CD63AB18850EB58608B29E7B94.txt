Capezio Brite Lights Dancesneaker
These shoes are so lightweight! I love them! They even come with different colored laces. My only complaint is that it appears that Capezio is no longer true to size. Had to exchange for a half size larger.
Love the shoes. Many friends have asked where I got them. Would recommend buying 1/2 size larger than you usually wear. Mine are a little short. They are great for zumba and Jazzercise.
After trying four other styles of shoes recommended for Zumba, I finally found the perfect shoes for me in Capezio Brite Lights Dancesneaker. They are very lightweight and comfortable, but with lots of ankle and foot support, which I needed. The soles are great for dancing, allowing for turns and swivels without slipping or sticking to the floor. I just purchased a second pair to hold in reserve. These shoes do run small. I normally wear a size 8Â½-9 and ordered a 10 which fit perfectly.
I ordered a full size bigger and it fit perfect! Great for zumba moves but the split sole is hard to get used to. I've had them a month and still not sure I like the split sole. Fit and ability to slide in glass is good though.
I like these shoes because they are soft and conforms to your foot.  It feels like you aren't even wearing a shoe, but still absorbs the shock of the floor.  According to researchers, you use less oxygen when you wear a lighter shoe. Ideal for African dancing.  Also, it has good ankle support.  Personally, I would recommend ordering a half size bigger than your street shoe as to prevent toe cramming after wearing it for an extended period of time.  I like them and I do intense West African dancing three to four times a week.
