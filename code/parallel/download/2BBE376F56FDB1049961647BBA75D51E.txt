Saucony ProGridâ„¢ Razor 2.0
I have just received this running shoes 2 days ago so didn't have time to try them out since I have injured ankle. But I want to share my opinion about the size and hope that will this help future buyers. I have been watching them for a while and wasn't sure what size to choose, in Croatia I am size40, that would be UK7 and US9 but more importantly my feet are 25.3 cm long. Fortunately, found out somewhere on the web that this Sauconys in US9 are 25.4 cm long (10"). I have read many reviews and info about them and especially was curious about the length of the inner foot bed and sole in centimeters. I have also been advised to go 1/2 size up due to the inner shoe, thank good I didn't. 
Fortunately since I have feet of normal width (not too narrow and not wide)I decided to take the size I usually wear, US9 and they fit perfectly. Although on the shoe tongue says size : US9, UK7 and EUR 40.5 they are definetely EUR 40!
Hope this will help somebody ;)
