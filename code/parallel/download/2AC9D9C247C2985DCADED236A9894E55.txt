Pearl Izumi syncroFuel™ Trail II
These are cool shoes. Admittedly, I buy trail runners a lot on style and cushioning. These do run between a half to a full size small. I normally wear 10½ or 11, but had to get 11½ in these to work. I am still breaking them in. I have wide feet, and I think after some wearing these will break in comfortably.
