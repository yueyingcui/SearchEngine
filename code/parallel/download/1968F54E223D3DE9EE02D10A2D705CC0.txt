Merrell Lorelei Leather Zip
Extremely comfortable and pretty cute, too! Re: Sizing...in non-athletic shoes, I usually wear a 5.5, but the 6 fits me. Perhaps a 1/2 size larger than your normal shoe will fit better? Or I just have goofy, inscrutable feet.
These look great with jeans.  I ordered my size but needed to return them for a half-size smaller. The smaller size is a perfect fit!
I normally wear size 8 - 8.5.  In the Jungle Moc by Merrell, I'm an 8, but I'm an 8.5 in this shoe so you may want to order a half size up!  The zipper is not very easy to manage, but that's the only negative thing.  Comfortable, casual shoe for work!
Finally found that "just because" red shoe I've always wanted. Casual, cute, comfortable, and a gorgeous scarlet red. The zipper gives me a way to relieve pressure on my high instep if it feels irritated. Sizewise, an 8.5 feels somewhat longer than the same size in the Merrell Siren Ginger sandal, so I'm not really sure what my true Merrell size is. There's not a lot of cushioning in a light, little shoe like this, but it's fine for running errands, walking the dog, etc. The heel doesn't feel quite as well cushioned as a similar Privo shoe I bought several years ago, but I like the insole better. Instead of being rubber with little bumps, the Merrell insole is a smooth fabric (?). I'm thinking about ordering these in black, too.

I was a fan of Merrell shoes when they made my size 12. However, they seem to have discontinued women’s size 12 so I thought 11 might fit... no good, but almost... enough that I took them to a shoemaker to stretch for me. I've worn them but not very comfortable. Hey Merrell, please bring back women’s size 12!!! I can't be the only one!
