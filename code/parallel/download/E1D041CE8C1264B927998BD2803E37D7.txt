Salomon XR Crossmax Neutral
Great and comfortable shoe. I recently used these on a trip out west and they were incredibly comfortable everywhere from walking around town, hiking, trail running and even into the river. Fantastic shoe. Shoes run about a 1/2 size smaller than normal.
Very, very comfortable and fit very well. I usually get size 9 for running shoes, but 8.5 worked better with this pair. One small drawback is the lacing system, which can be difficult to balance an overall tight fit without it becoming too tight at the cinch point. But once you get used to just how to set up your laces, it’s not a problem anymore – you’ll most likely be really happy with them. These shoes are surprisingly grippy and comfortable on roads as well. I’m going to buy another pair with the Clima Shield (CS) for winter running.
Awesome shoes! True to size, grippy on rocks, I always use an orthotic, but the standards are good, too. Took them on a trail hike with mixed class 3/4 scrambling and a stream crossing, they held up well, dried quickly, and kept crud and sand off my feet. They're definitely more of a running shoe than the GTX Pro's whereas those are more of a trail shoe, tough to say when you own both. :)
Anyone with tender, jacked feet from the military should own two pairs of these shoes. Laces are a bit long, but just cut the excess off and reknot. they run half a size bigger than what is marked. I wear 11, so I bought 10½ which fit perfectly.
