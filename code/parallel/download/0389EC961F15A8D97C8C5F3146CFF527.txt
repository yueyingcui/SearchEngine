PUMA Suede Classic
Comfortable shoe, but needs an insole if you will be standing or walking a lot. Blue is more faded than in pic. Came a half size large. I dig the large laces.
This is a classic pair I used back in college (some 20 years ago). I think the appearance have changed since then. The sole seems thinner. Fit is true to size. I felt that the image on the screen does not reflect the actual look of it. I mean, the suede black color is not that black in the actual.
I've worn the same size of Puma Suedes for 16 years. The pair I just bought are slightly narrower than any pair I've owned before. It may only be a slight change, but it's noticeable when looking at them and putting them on. For me, they definitely feel different, but not necessarily uncomfortable. I still love 'em, but I sincerely hope they don't continue to narrow.
The primary thing I felt about this shoe when I first put it on is how much more I felt the ground beneath my feet. I like that sensation, but it's not for everyone. This is not a running shoe, to be sure! After having worn these for a year and a half now, the white leather on the sides is starting to come off the shoe, but I do wear them regularly. I can see myself getting another year of use out of them. I am regularly complimented on these and highly recommend them. They felt true to size for me (I wear a 13).
Good looking shoe. B-boy style. It's more grey than black, but the suede makes it perfect for work or going out. Got a lot of compliments while wearing them out on the town. Came with old school fat black laces. Not too much padding around ankles and tongue, but enough. Make sure to order 1 size bigger. I did and it was still snug. No arch support or cushioning inside.
