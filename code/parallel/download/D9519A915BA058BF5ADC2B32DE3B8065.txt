Nike Overplay VII Nubuck
I just got these shoes today and they were so comfortable, the width was perfect and the size was brilliant!
Although we loved the style of these shoes, beware that they run very narrow. My son tried several sizes and he usually does not need a wide shoe, but these are overly narrow.
