Timberland PRO Willow Trail
Wide width runs narrow. This is a great shoe, but even ordering up 1/2 size in wide width is too narrow.
I guess I didn't realize that this was a steel-toed work shoe when I purchased it, but given that I work in a warehouse I thought I'd give them a fair evaluation. They felt "big" for the size, especially in comparison to the other shoes I ordered and tried on at the same time. I am wearing mid-weight bamboo socks; perhaps they would fit better if I were wearing athletic socks. The style is nice; they just felt too "boxy" for me. Deepest toe box I've ever seen on an athletic-style shoe.
