Merrell Eagle Origins
Super comfortable and light.  Perfect for just about everything.  May not work for hikes in the Himalayas but who cares?  I'm not going there anytime soon.  The fit is true to size.  The colors are a bit odd, but again, who cares?  There going to fade and your feet are more important and likely just as odd looking.
