Frye Greene Tall Lace
I usually wear a 12-13 size shoe. I bought these at size 12 and they were a little big before I put a sole insert. They run a little big. Good shoe though the sewing along the lace line wasn't done very well so I'm pulling out pieces of thread as I loosen and tighten the laces. Not a deal breaker but not as high quality as I had hoped for this amount of bucks.
Back to the Future - 
Canvas low and high top sneakers are in and this is a high fashion makeover of those classics. The washed leather is handsome, details are all just right except perhaps for the silly attempts to make the toe and edges look "dirty" (I can take care of that myself). Shoes are comfortable, true to size and better looking and less expensive than some of the other upscale reinventions of the high top sneaker.
