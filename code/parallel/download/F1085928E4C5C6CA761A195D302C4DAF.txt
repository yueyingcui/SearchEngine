Nike Kids T-Run 3 Alt (Toddler/Youth)
I bought a half size up since my son's foot was growing like crazy. So glad I did! He likes these shoes. They look good and easy to put on! Essential for a mother of three!
My son is 5 years old and loves these shoes, as he can get them on and off by himself. They are true to size wear incredibly well for an active outdoor boy.
These shoes fit my son true to size.  He loves the way they look.  Great Nike quality.  Will order this style again.
