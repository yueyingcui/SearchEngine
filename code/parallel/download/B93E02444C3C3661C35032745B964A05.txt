Sperry Kids Bluefish Hook & Loop (Infant/Toddler)
I love these shoes and my son gets so many compliments on them! The fit is great and true to size. My son has wide feet and they still fit perfectly!
So adorable! Fit is true to size. They look cute and stay on perfectly. Love not dealing with the laces!
I ordered these for my daughter soon after she started walking because they stay on so much better than the girls' ones that all have ties. She loves them, we love them. They are gender neutral enough that it's not obvious she has on boy shoes and we've gotten lots of compliments on them. Ordering a bigger size now for spring!
Great shoes! These are my son's third pair of Sperrys! A lot of previous reviews claim they are too narrow, but my son doesn't have a wide foot so they seem to fit true to size. Love the Velcro. It makes putting his shoes on super quick. These are cute little shoes that can be dressed up and they also make great play shoes!
My son was just measured at Stride Rite as a 5.5W. He has a high instep, so I ordered these shoes in 5.5W. but I couldn't get them on his feet. They seem to run a whole size smaller and are very narrow. Adorable though and well made!
Shoes are cute, but they are too narrow (I even ordered a wide). I ordered a whole size bigger than my child wears due to the prior recommendations, but it is still too narrow. I will be returning the shoes. Disappointed.

Adore this shoe - 
This shoe is so cute. My son does not want to take them off. Very true to size and make sure they are sprayed with a leather protector keep looking nice and new.
