Hi-Tec Kids TT Elastic Lace (Toddler/Youth)
After 6 weeks happy with durability. We normally purchase Skechers for the rubber that covers the toes, and happy with these as an alternative. With the insert in (size 2) fits my son who normally wears 2.5. Only drawback is inside surface of shoe when insert is removed for size 2.5; material seems like cardboard & flakes out, not good if shoes get wet in rain. I would still purchase the shoes again, great fit and wear.
True to size.  Look a bit more like hikers but perform well as sneakers.   Perfect for kids that don't want to tie shoes.  
Great shoes! I was happy they come in a bigger sizes. My 11 year old said shoes are comfy and look cool.
