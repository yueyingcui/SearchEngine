Puma Kids Roma Basic (Infant/Toddler)
I bought these sneakers (size 8) for my 18 month old son. What I like most is their lightweight. These sneakers are super cute, too! They go well with almost every outfit I've put him in, and he's been getting compliments left & right! My only concern is the back of the sneakers may be rubbing up against his heel. Since he is still a "baby", getting him to tell me if the sneakers bother him is a constant yes/no fest. He doesn't try to claw them off or cry & I don't see any signs of damage, but he does seem to walk a lot slower in these shoes than he has with other shoes -- as if he is slightly uncomfortable. I don't know, I'll be on the look out for any more signs of discomfort. Other than that, the sneakers are just great! I highly recommend them.
