Reebok Lifestyle Classic Ballistic EXT
Good Shoe - 
The shoe fits well and was shipped promptly. It feels true to size; the picture and description on the web site are accurate depictions of the product. I was very satisfied with the transaction. 

These shoes seem to run a little big, about a size. I usually wear a 13 and I had to order a 12 of these. But they look great and feel great.
