Nike Kids Vapor Strike Low TD 3 BG (Youth)
Good shoe with MAJOR flaw: no toe cleat. Upper looks like an American football shoe. Bottom looks like a soccer shoe. This problem is on the youth sizes only. Look at the adult size soles: toe cleat. Too bad could be a good show otherwise. I feel badly for the kids that don't know any better and use these shoes for football.
