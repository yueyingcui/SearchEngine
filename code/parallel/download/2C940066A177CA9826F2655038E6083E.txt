Sanuk Cadet
These are quite comfortable.  It feels like I'm walking around in slippers which I like.  I mostly use them for around the office or house or short trips outside.  I wouldn't wear them for longer walks since they don't have a lot of support.  They are vegan though and comfortable and cute so I'd recommend them.  I've tried other styles from Sanuk and they were not as comfortable as these.  These stay on my feet well because of the straps on top whereas the other styles I've tried from Sanuk did not have the straps and didn't feel as secure on my feet when I walked in them. I wear a size 6 1/2 and I have these in size 6 and they fit well.
I really like this style variation. I ordered my usual size but wouldn't be able to wear socks with them. Without socks, the fit is just right. I think they're a little overpriced for the product.
I am a size 9.5 shoe. I ordered these Sanuks in a size 9. They are snug and cozy, but not too much so. I'm assuming they will stretch out as I wear them. I prefer my Sanuks to be slightly on the smaller side rather than too big.
These are my first pair of Saunks. I love the way they look, love that they are vegan. I would recommend ordering a size up. I am normally a 7Â½, sometimes 8. I ordered an 8 and they are nearly too small but I think a 9 would be too big. I am hoping that they will stretch. They are just a tad on the narrow side. My other concern is that there is a rough seam right on top of the bone under my big toe. I hope they will become more comfortable with time.
These shoes are adorable. I have very wide feet with a high foot top and while they did not fit like a glove right out of the bag like my other Sanuks, they became comfortable after a couple of wears. I ordered these shoes in both colors in half a size larger than I normally wear. I only wish they came in black as well.
