These are amazing shoes. My son wore them almost every day for 4 months and they still look great. I just ordered the next two larger sizes, because we are so happy with the quality, style and value.
Great shoe! My son has a wide foot, so it's difficult to find a shoe that fits! Sadly, I should've ordered him a size 7 instead of a 6.5 but these shoes run true to size! Love the shoe though! We will definitely make an exchange! Light, and comfortable for baby!
