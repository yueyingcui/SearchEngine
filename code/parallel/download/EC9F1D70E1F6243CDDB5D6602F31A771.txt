I work in the fitness industry and teach circuit classes.  These shoes feel like air, but perform with the strength of older heavier designs.  I will definitely use these as my number 1, go-to pair.  I have high arches and had no problem.
They run true to size.
I really like these shoes. I found them to be true to size. I have very wide feet and they fit me perfectly. They are light-weight and comfy.  Great Buy!
This is a great cross trainer shoe. I have been wearing it for the past 2 weeks. I've worn it on the treadmill for jogging and walking, on the elliptical and in cardio kickboxing class which is extremely high impact. I have no problems with numb toes on the elliptical (which is a common problem with a lot of shoes). The shoe is comfortable, light and true to size. My feet are a little wide although I wear medium width shoes. I bought my regular size and have had no issues.
Hmmm. Not so awesome. The design looks great in the picture. The materials are cheap. Too much plastic. The ankle pad is so high that it rubs on your ankle. It runs a half size large. I wear 8.5 and I would need thick socks to feel comfortable, or order a size 8.
