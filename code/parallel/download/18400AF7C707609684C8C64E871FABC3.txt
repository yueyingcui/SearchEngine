Nike Free Haven 3.0
I bought these shoes for training, and they were not what I had expected.  I am a runner and to me, these shoes provided no support whatsoever.  I know this is a training shoe but still there is no foot support.  It feels like you are wearing close fitting sandals.  Also, it seemed like that breath ability of this shoe was limited due to the fact that it is all made out of a synthetic diamond pattern material; there is no mesh.  However, the shoe does fit very true to size if you were to figure out your size on nike.com.  I am going to give the free run+ 3.Os a try.  I think they will be better fit.
Heed the size warnings: I have always taken a 10.5 with Nike's Free line. These 10.5s feel like a size 10 - I once got a 10 and they literally feel the same size. Go up a half size from usual and you'll be good to go!
I work at a local sporting good store in my hometown and I strongly recommend Nike Free's. They are comfortable, flexible and light weight. This is the number one seller on my list and I also recommend ordering a half a size up than regular. I wear a size 10 though in Frees I wear a 10.5.
After reading one review, I ordered the shoes half a size bigger. They fit perfectly. They are comfortable and I have no problems with them.
