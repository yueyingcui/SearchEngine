Shoes look great, but the fit needs to be one-half size larger than my normal size. In other words, I would like to exchange the size 7 for a size 7-1/2.
I wear men's size 7 which are hard to find, the Ecco's & FootJoy's were still too long. These fit the best. After about 7-8 rounds, they are nicely broken in and feel great.
Made a switch from traditional golf shoes to these and really loving it.  Super comfortable to walk in and I feel grounded when swinging my driver. Even wear them around the house occasionally. They are sized accurately too.
I returned these shoes as I tend to wear 'wide' shoes for comfort. The ECCO shoes were comfortable, but these were tight and created a heal blister. I liked the price, color, and quality construction. Impressive if you are looking street golf shoes. But the sizes are very close to their stated size.
These are very comfortable. They are true to size and a great style.

I bought this shoe in an 11.  It looks ridiculous in the larger size.  Look at the top view of this shoe, which is probably an 8, and imagine that the increase in size means more distance between the bottom of the laces and the strip around the front.  That strip does not change size and looks awful hanging out at the front of the shoe like a little moustache.  I was so disappointed.
Me: 105 lbs. Shoe size: 5 M. Age: 32. Golf level: Beginner. Pros: good fit, snug, no blisters after a round of 18, the grip is fine without the cleats & they're water resistant enough for Seattle. They are good looking too; finding golf shoes that are neither granny or butch is hard. Cons: the toes are black suede which I imagine will fade with time.
I like the look of this shoe and the lack of cleats. In my size (10 1/2), however, the front portion of the shoe is too narrow. From the picture I thought the shape would be more like a running shoe.
