Nike Kids Land Shark 2 Low BG (Toddler/Youth)
Nice looking shoe...too bad I need to return them because they are too small for my son...maybe ordering one size up is good.
Took a gamble and ordered these cleats as my son had never worn Nike before. He has a wide foot and high arch and I always thought Nikes would be too narrow. He is a size 4 and these size 4 cleats fit perfectly. They are flexible and comfortable - worn for daily practice and no blisters after 3 weeks of straight wear. Great!
This is a great football cleat! My son is 6 years old and he says the cleat is very comfortable. I would recommend buying the cleat at least a half size larger than his shoe size since they seem to run narrow.
