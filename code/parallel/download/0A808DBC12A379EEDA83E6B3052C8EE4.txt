The North Face Women's Hedgehog III
Love these! I've been backpacking in Europe & Asia for 4 months with these as my everywhere shoes, and have only just had to buy new insoles for them. They've gone up mountains, across rivers, and on 10-hour city walks and not let me down at all. I have very flat feet, and I've found these shoes just right in terms on arch support for me (I like it on the low side). You will need to replace them & adjust the tounge to work with your foot shape, but otherwise you should be good to go... And go... And keep going! 

I also agree with the going up half a size - I wear 8 or 8.5, and definitely needed the 8.5 in these! 
Outstanding! Didn't have to break them in at all. The best fit and comfortable. I would size up a 1/2 size.
We have been hiking in Arizona on trails in the desert and by far, the Hedgehog shoe is the best I have ever worn. True to size, comfortable, sturdy. It takes the impact as you are climbing or going down the trails. I recommend this walking shoe with such authority since as you can imagine the trails in the desert can be strenuous.
