Mizuno Wave® Nirvana™ 8 
Runs small, order 1/2 size up. Strange that my other Mizunos are size 7, but in this shoe, I need a 7 1/2. Beautiful shoe. Toe area should have had at least an inch more of the rubber covering, rather than mesh. 
Felt much shorter in length than Wave Creation in same size. The pink accents look very plastic and the mesh in person is much more like a black and white grid/checkerboard. Going back.
I love the way I was able to order the Mizunos and get them in 5 days. I live in Austin and had been to all of the major sports stores for this shoe and they didn't have my size or did not carry the Nirvana. Love the shoe. I am very hard on shoes and these are perfect for me.
Let me tell you these shoes are amazing! If you're thinking about it, the money is well worth it! In normal shoes I am a size 8; however, in Mizuno I am a 9 1/2. I would really go to a store to try them on before you buy.
