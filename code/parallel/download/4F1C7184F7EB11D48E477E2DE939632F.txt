These shoes are steez!  Definitely more yellow looking online though and I'd say they only feel a little bit bigger than their size but they're high tops so they're supposed to be that way, right?  Oh and I'm a chick so ladies go two sizes down from your original in womens!
The style is great. Im a size 17 and they were priced the same as a size 10.

Bought these for my daughter. They said to go 2 sizes smaller for a girl but I would say 1 1/2 as they may run a half size small. Over all she absolutely loves them and says they are very comfortable. The colors are exactly what they look like on here.
