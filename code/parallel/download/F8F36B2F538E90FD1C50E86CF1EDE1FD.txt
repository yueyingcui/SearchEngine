New Balance WW665
I needed a size 12-wide walking shoe to wear while recuperating from a foot injury, and this fits the bill.  It's not as supportive overall as I would prefer but I didn't want to spend a lot of money so I didn't expect the same features as in a $100 shoe.  Unfortunately the only color in my size was the Komen pink which is a truly hideous gray/silver with pink trim.
