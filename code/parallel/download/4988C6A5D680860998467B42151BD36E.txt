Very comfortable and no break-in required.  They do run smaller than usual so I had to go up a size. Because of past foot surgery and fallen arches, I have trouble finding a shoe I can walk in.  These accomodate my orthotics,  have plenty of toe room, and can be tightened enough to stay on my narrow heel. They are nice and lightweight and don't look big  even though they are a larger size.
