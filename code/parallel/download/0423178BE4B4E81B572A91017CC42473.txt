New Balance MR840
I have only used these shoes on a couple of runs, but the size seems to be correct and the stability is good. They also seem to have more than adequate cushioning in the soles. So far, I am satisfied.
This shoe is too short and the size 9 is too long but will have to do!  Very frustrating that the old version is no longer available and this cheap feeling untrue to size replacement is all there is.  People with wide feet needing large toe boxes should unite to make a better sneaker!
My chiropractor recommended these shoes.  I walk 3-4 miles every day and had started having some foot pain even though I change shoes every 4-6 months.  These shoes were true to size, very comfortable as soon as I put them on. 
It is hard to find good shoes for a supinator (under pronator), especially in size 15EEEE, but this shoe fits the bill and has given me the cushion to run effectively despite my odd feet, stride, and size. I pulled out the flat inserts and put in my own to fit my arch.
I have the NB 883 that I love and was looking for another wide sneaker. These are them. I have 15 EEEE size and these two are the only ones that feet right. Need large toe box and width. NB calls them the SL-2 Last which fits well for me.
Replacement for the 883. I had to get half size larger in this shoe than the 883. Cushioning very similar to 883.
