SKECHERS KIDS Light Ray 10244L Lights (Toddler/Youth)
My daughter loves these shoes, are really cute. They have mesh so they can breathe, which is important when wearing for 7 straight hours at school. The dark pink color looks cute with all her clothes and seems to hide dirt pretty well. Happy with this purchase. I think Skechers run small, my daughter wears a full size bigger in Skechers than other brands. However, these were a perfect fit knowing that.
