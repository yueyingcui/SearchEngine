adidas Originals Kids Superstar 2 Core (Youth)
My boys love these super cool addidas. 
They fit their 1/2 size feet well.  They are very comfy.  I love the different colors.  They look good with school clothes and even dressed up in a jacket and tie.  They are keepers and now the only shoes I buy for my sons.  
These are the second pair I purchased for my 9 year old son and he loves them! They are true to size and the blue stripes add a splash of color and look nice with jeans, shorts, khaki pants! Go for it, you won't be disappointed!
All three of my kids wear these as their uniform shoe for school.  They're equally loved by my sons and daughter.  They're durable, comfortable, and true to size.  Four years and going strong!  I keep the next size up in their closets.
Bought these for my daughter.  She wears a ladies 6 1/2 in a sneaker.  Got these kids' size in a 4.  She loves them, very comfy.
My son loves these shoes. They are true to size and are very comfortable. The color is great, too.

These are working great for my active 8-year-old with bigger feet (size 4.5). He usually tore through the toes of athletic shoes pretty quickly, but these are nice and tough! I was running out the door in an emergency and threw them on myself, and they were just a tad snug widthwise on me with a 6.5/7 women's foot. Just ordered a pair for an older son, and am considering a white/white pair for myself in a Youth 5 if they become available. Guess you can tell that we give them a double thumbs up!
