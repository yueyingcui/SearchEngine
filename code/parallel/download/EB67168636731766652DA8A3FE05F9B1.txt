New Balance WW895
Love this shoe. Even though I have wear an extra wide shoe size, the regular wide width fit great. 
Love these lightweight athletic shoes! So very comfortable, almost feels like wearing slippers. There's a solid wavy tread on the bottom, and soft uppers. The style and bright color grab others' attention and comments. My true size is 9.5 Slim, and the New Balance 9.5 Narrow fits well. From my view, I would prefer not to wear these for impact activities such as running. In my case, I have over-pronated feet, and even with orthotics inserted, these would not provide enough stability.
