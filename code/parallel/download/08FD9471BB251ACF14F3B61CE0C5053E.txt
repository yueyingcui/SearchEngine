Propet Leisure Walker Strap
Love the shoes, they are sized correctly for my feet, and fit very nicely. Good shoes help my back pain go away. I would like to suggest one thing about the design of these shoes. The velcro straps are put on with the hooks at the base, and the loops at the end of the strap. They work fine, except the exposed hooks latch onto everything the can, carpet, clothes, grass, fuzz, everything. I would recommend putting the loops at the base of the strap, and the hooks at the end.
Love these shoes. I walk over 3 miles a day. These shoes are very comfortable and true to size and width. Have a 1000 mile guarantee. I got that plus before the soles started to wear. This is my 2nd pair. Same comfort as the first. Will continue to buy this shoe.
I wear a size 15. It is not a pleasure for me to shop. For years I was limited to wing tip shoes in black or brown but now that I am semi-retired I am delighted to have found your site. My Propet shoes are fabulous, the service was perfect and I am right now going to order a second pair.

First shoes since operation - 
A recent hip replacement operation lengthened my leg so I no longer have to have shoes than a lift can be put into the sole. I wanted something easy to put on and looked nice. The new Prop√©t Leisure Walking shoes are great. They are sized correctly and have a good arch, plus are easy for me to get on with my hip replacement.

This is a comfortable, easy to wear walker. I bought it for my husband who has trouble with shoelaces because of arthritis in his hands. I bought the size shoe he normally wears but could have gone half a size smaller. He has a 3E width and this is true to width size.
