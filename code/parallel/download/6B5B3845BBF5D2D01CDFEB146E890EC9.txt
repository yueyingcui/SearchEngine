Nike Action Braata LR W
I really wanted to love these because they were so adorable on, but alas, so narrow! I run a little on the wider side to begin with, but these were much more narrow than expected. I went a size up and still couldn't fit properly with socks, even thin ones. Bummed, had to send back.
I've always been a Nike fan. These shoes are super comfortable! Nike always seems to run their sizes an half inch too big, it's something they've always had. So if you own any Nike shoes that fit, use that size. What I like most about these shoes is that I haven't had to break them in. They don't rub against the back of your fault, so that means no blisters! They're a great buy! I will be buying the other color.
These are the best shoes ever! I am a busy mom of two and am always on the look out for cute, comfortable, easy to put on and take off shoes and these ones did the trick. I have very high arches and these shoes are so comfortable. I am a size 8 and ordered an 8 but I would say that I might even be able to go with a 7Â½ so they may run a bit big.
