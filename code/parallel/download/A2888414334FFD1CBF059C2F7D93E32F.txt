PUMA El Ace Ballet Stripes Wn's
These shoes are cute, true to size, and go with a variety of outfits. However, after walking in them for only about an hour, the logo tags on the backs started peeling off. After about 2 hours walking in them (same day, I was on vacation), my feet were killing me. 

So I guess as long as you don't buy them for long walks in Paris, you should be okay.
I'm a true 7 1/2.  The 7 1/2 was too long.  Was going to order a smaller size but didn't love them enough.  Trying a Josef Seibel for a casual sneaker instead.
