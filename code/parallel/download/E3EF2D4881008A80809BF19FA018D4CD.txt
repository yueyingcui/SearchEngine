Nike Overplay VII
Nike with a 'wide' option, that's all I ask for. These fit well and have nice sole support. Should get size bigger plus wide if you are using custom insoles.
These are a bit cramped. If you never wore basketball shoes, you really feel the difference. It is best if you go 1-3 sizes larger so you get the comfort and manueverability. Overall these are great shoes, but it is best to try them out for yourself.
