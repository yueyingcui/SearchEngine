Reebok Lifestyle Classic Nylon W
These are great shoes. I ordered up half a size as others suggested and find them a bit wider in the toe but still a perfect fit. They are perfect for my casual life style.
These sneakers are just perfect! The fit is awesome and feel is superb! It has that vintage, yet classic look. I had to order 1/2 size larger.
I bought these a size larger than my normal size because I like lots of toe space when I exercise and they're actually very small. They're like my standard shoe size!
These shoes are wonderful! I am a waitress and on my feet for at least 5-8 hours a day, and these shoes are very comfortable. I do have a high arch which these shoes don't support but even without the arch support these shoes are still very comfortable. The other review said these shoes run about a half a size small, which is true! Order a bigger size. You won't be disappointed!
These sneakers are light weight and extremely comfortable. I have a wide foot with bunions that are very sensitive and i can wear this sneaker in a medium width size. Because they are cloth, they have a lot of give. I have them in multiple colors and love them.
Walked all over China in these. Cool, comfortable, with enough support to keep my feet pain free all day. I did need to buy one half size larger than usual.
I love these shoes, but they're just a tiny bit small for the size. You buy sneakers for comfort, but if they don't fit right you won't wear them much. I wish I had gotten one half size larger, but instead I got the size I always get with these same shoes. 
Since Reebok has changed manufacturing countries, these are running shorter. You need to order at least a full size larger. They also do not provide the cushion they did when made in China.
