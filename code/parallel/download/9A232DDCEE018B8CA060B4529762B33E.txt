adidas Originals Kids Gazelle 2 H&L (Infant/Toddler)
These shoes are adorable and my son loves them!  Although it's sometimes hard to tell with a 3 year old, I think the shoes are comfortable and true to size.
I love these shoes and the color. However, I had to return them because they run really small. My son wears an 8 or 8Â½ and these shoes were too small for him. Unfortunately when I did return them they did not have his size so I had to purchase them from the manufacturer's website.
