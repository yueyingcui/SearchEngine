ASICS Omniflex Pursuitâ„¢
Awesome shoe! The product video didn't show that the tongue has velcro where you can tuck the laces in. Also, the uppers are a kind of nylon mesh which form around your foot. The laces actually go up sideways and the shoe has a 'gladiator' look. Definitely go with a 1/2 size larger than you would normally buy.
