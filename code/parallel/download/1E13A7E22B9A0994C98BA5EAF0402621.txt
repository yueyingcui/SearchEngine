Native Shoes Hugo
Will be returning these.  Strange, strange fit.  As one of the other reviews mentioned, longer than marked; order a half size down.  Also, much narrower than you would anticipate.  If you have even a moderately wide foot, stay away.  
Shoe is nice, but sizing is way off. I wear a 10 in everything sometimes even a 10 1/2, this shoe in a 10 felt more like an 11 1/2. Order one size down, at least
