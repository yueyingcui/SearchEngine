etnies Kids Fader (Toddler/Youth)
My daughter loves these shoes! They seem pretty true to size. They are comfortable although kind of clunky, but that's the style. A possible downside is that the laces can be hard to tie because, having to cross all that padding, they are pretty short.
Super cute and comfortable - 
My 3 year old daughter loves these! One of the best features is the well cushioned tongue, so you can tie the shoes nice and tightly and there is no stress on the top of the foot. I bought them about a size larger to give her room to grow, and I can tie them tightly enough that she is still comfortable. They are also easy to clean and hold up well to vigorous play.
