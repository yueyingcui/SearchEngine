adidas Originals Kids Samoa H&L (Infant/Toddler)
These shoes are very cute. But, they run big, I feel almost a half size. My two year old son wears them everyday and they look brand new! Great quality. This is his 2nd pair of Adidas and I would definitely purchase another pair. 
My son absolutely loves this shoe! I bought them in a size 6 and purchased another shoe for him when he outgrew them. However he always wanted his adidas so I had to order them in a 7 and an 8, for when he needs the 8.
What an adorable sneaker for my son!  Too bad it was too small.  This shoe is made very small and narrow.  He generally wears a size 4 and that runs a little big on him.  I ordered a size 5 and it was still too small.  They're so cute though that I'm going to try a size 6....
These are super cute but they didn't work for my 3 year old, who tried them on and after 10 seconds wanted them off. He loves the Adidas Dragon style, which look identical but they are much softer and lighter weight (perfect for summer). I'll be buying more of the Adidas Dragon style. Also, I think these run a little small. (Whereas he wears a size 7 in Vans and other shoes, he needed 7.5 in the Adidas.)
These shoes are fantastic. Bought them in a smaller size previously. Love them.
My 2.5 yr. old loves these shoes, I keep on buying new sizes. They are perfect for outside play, appear very sturdy, don't show dirt, can be easily washed. They do appear a bit tough, sole does't bend but my child prefers them so I trust his idea of comfort.
Great shoe, fits true to size. They came the next day so I was pleasantly surprised.
I love, love, love these shoes! And my son gets so many compliments on his Adidas. I'll say this every time - if he doesn't constantly try to take them off, that means they must be comfortable. 
It's great that Adidas makes half sizes for kids, because shoes that are a little big or a little small will get pulled off immediately.
