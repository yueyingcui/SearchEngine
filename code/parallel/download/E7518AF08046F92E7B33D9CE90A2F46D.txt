adidas Originals Samoa
Really comfortable! There was no need to break them in. I ordered a half-size up as was recommended by other reviews. 
Love my Samoas! I bought the platinum (grey) on white. I got a lot of compliments from men and women these are some "clean" kicks, perfect for summer wear! I wear size 9 (women's), and got the 7.5 men's for a perfect fit. The leather is soft and the sneaker is very comfortable.
Not the best arch support and a little narrow but will do fine outside of the gym and off the field. Best really as a very stylish casual shoe, not any sort of athletic shoe. 

These do not run large at all and I had to go a half size up to find a pair that fits.
Love this shoe. So comfortable! True to size, feels great! Looks great! A true classic!
This is then 2nd pair of Samoas that I've purchased.  I can't say one bad word.  Fit and style are great and the price is right.  Based on previous reviews, I went a half size up and the shoe feels perfect.
