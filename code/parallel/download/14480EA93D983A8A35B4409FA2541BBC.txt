Keds Kids Hello KittyÂ® - Mimmy H&L Sneaker (Infant/Toddler)
These shoes are really cute. I couldn't tell this by looking at the picture, but they actually have some sparkle to it, with was such a nice bonus! My daughter is in love with them. She usually wears a size 9 toddler, but those were a little too big, we're exchanging them for the 8.5 size.
