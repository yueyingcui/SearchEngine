SKECHERS Stamina - Approach
It was a really good deal. I just had them when and where I wanted them, in their box, on color, size and shape. Real good, and they feel like they seem to.
They were everything I look for, the size I ordered fit perfect and they ship quick. I'm very please with my order, the cost was lower than what it was in my city.

My husband and I bought these shoes a year ago; they were very comfortable, had plenty of room and came in sizes large enough for his feet. The only issue we have with them is they've already worn out! The sides have torn out leaving holes in the cloth.
