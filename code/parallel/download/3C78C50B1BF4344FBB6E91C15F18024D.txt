Ryka assist xt 2â„¢
I take heavy cardio workout classes and was looking for a shoe that has great support, cushioning, comfort and is stylish. This shoe is it. It is so comfortable that I don't even put in my orthotic for added support. It runs true to size which most athletic shoes don't. I would highly recommend it!
I ordered these in my usual size and they were too small on me. Then I ordered a larger size and they were a little too large and there was something rubbing on my inside arch of my foot. I don't know, I always buy Ryka shoes but these were not right for me. I liked the look of them though.
I purchased this pair of shoes to wear at the gym on the days that I work on the machines and cycle. They are great! Lightweight, yet supportive and very comfortable. I ordered my regular size and had to return them for a half size smaller.
