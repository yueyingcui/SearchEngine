Merrell Barefoot Swift Glove
I love these shoes. I ordered both a 7 [my regular size] and a 7.5. The 7 fit my heel and instep perfectly but was just a bit too short, so I'm keeping the 7.5. The barefoot technology is already working my leg muscles!
Just received and have to return. They fit everywhere except the right shoe is maybe 1/4-1/2 size too short. If I order a size bigger, they'll not fit anywhere except in the right toe. Nice looking shoe; comfortable everywhere except that short right shoe. Gave Style only 2 stars because it seems unnecessarily fussy.
