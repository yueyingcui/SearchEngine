UGG Laela
Love them! Was very skeptical after reading the reviews about how hard they are to get on.  Well not for me.  I did however order a half size up because I have rather wide feet. I had a few surgeries so tight shoes really bother me.  I have no problem even with socks. 
I bought these for my grand-daughter but had to exchange them for a 1/2 size larger. She loves them and the exchange was sooooo easy.
We love the way you make purchases and exchanges painless.
Love this shoe but it ran a half size too big for the length. If I go down a half size, it will be too narrow, so I have no choice but to return.
The shoes is really cute and comfortable but runs 1/2 size small.  Not many stores carry it.
These shoes are super-comfy and are great for walking. They run true to size and they have a cool look, I think.
Really cute sneaker but unlike the UGG boots, should size UP at least 1/2 size. Boo-hoo!
These are wonderful...cute and very comfortable.  I now choose my clothes every day, so that I can wear these shoes.  They run true to size.
