Nike City Court VII
The look is flashy but not too much so they keep me fashionable - maybe.  Though I still lost the first few racquetball games I played wearing them I can tell they will be an asset if my game picks up a notch. I ordered 1/2 size larger than normal and the fit is right a bit snug in the width but that is already working itself out.  Good shoes at a good price
I wanted a relatively inexpensive tennis shoe and this fit the bill. I'm usually around a size 8 or 9 and with this shoe I'm definitely a 9 (the 8.5 was too narrow).
Very reliable shoe here it seems like although my main point of concern for someone not sure on sizing is to definitely not consider these a tight fitting shoe. They seem to run really true to size with plenty of room for your toes and lots of lateral free space as well. Basically very comfortable and sturdy, but definitely not something to size up on in my opinion. 
Very nice and comfy but make sure to order half size larger. I ordered a 7.5 and had to exchange them for an 8 but other than that it's good for tennis.
