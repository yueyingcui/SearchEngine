Timberland PRO Gorge Multi-Purpose Outdoor Steel Toe
These shoes were quite disappointing. I bought them based on having a pair of Timberland Pro steel-toed boots that fit and have held up well for years. These shoes have no arch support and the toe cap is painfully narrow and low. The length is a bit long, so going up in size to get more room from the toe cap means not having my toes in the cap. Timberland should take more care in their sizing to be consistent, as these are different in size and proportion to my other pair of theirs in the same size.
