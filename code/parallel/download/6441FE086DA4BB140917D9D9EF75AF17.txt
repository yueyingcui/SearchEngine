New Balance Classics M574 - Leather
Purchased these sneakers for my grandson; he wears a large size shoe and has weak arches. He loves the shoes because they are very comfortable and allow room for his orthotics. He also likes the style.The shoe could be improved with added arch support. Shoe feels true to size.
