Pearl Izumi SyncroFloatÂ® IV
Fantastic shoes, was a long time Mizuno Creation fan, but after recent changes and being disappointed in recent fit, I have switched exclusively to these. Have had three pairs, and will purchase more before they change. Definitely suggest a 1/2 size larger than one would purchase in a Mizuno, New Balance, or Asics.
This shoe has extra heel cushioning so order one full size larger than normal shoe size.  I wear a 10 in all shoes, except for running I wear a 10.5.  SycroFloat IV, I need a size 11 women's.
Love my Pearls. I've been wearing different styles for years. This particular style runs small. Had to order one full size larger than normal. Don't know what is up with that, but as long as you order big you should be happy.
This runs the same size as my previous Pearls. They were the same model name. They have great cushion and pronation control.
I love this shoe - so comfortable for the first wearing. If you have a high arch and a wide forefoot - order 1/2 size up - you'll be glad you did!
