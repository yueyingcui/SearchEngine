Tsukihoshi Kids Lynx (Toddler/Youth)
Shoe is sized as marked for length but there is extra room on top so the laces need to be drawn very tightly. It's not too wide either. Very odd.
These shoes are fantastic! Lightweight and perfect for everyday school wear! They are very true to size and you do not need to size up. They include growing room in the size they have marked!
My 6 year loves her new shoes! This is the second pair of Tsukihoshi shoes she has had and she says they are the most comfortable shoe she has ever worn and she is picky! In the past she has mostly worn Saucony and Stride Rite. This has by far been her favorite! She says they make her bounce! The Tsukihoshi Speed (her last pair) ran about a half size larger, but this shoe the Lynx seemed very true to size for us. The color is also very pretty in person. I wasn't sure how I would like them but they are very cute and kid appropriate! I have not washed this shoe yet, but her last pair of Tsukihoshi shoes were machine washed several times and lasted for a long time!
