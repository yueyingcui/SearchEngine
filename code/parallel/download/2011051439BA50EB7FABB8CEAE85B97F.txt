ASICS Gel-3030â„¢
I absolutely love this shoe! I am a late-stage pronator in one foot and this shoe addresses that problem perfectly. However, one word of warning - this shoe runs on the small side. I did not notice this until I increased my mileage to 10+ miles. Once I hit the double digits I started experiencing black toenails and blisters so had to move into this shoe a full size larger than street shoe size (from 1/2 size larger).
I run about 3 miles/day 5 to 6 days a week. These shoes have so much support, but it is a little too much! I have very flat feet and used my own orthodics. After the first use I developed a good size blister on the bottom of my foot where the arch of the foot is. I thought the more I wore the shoe the less it would rub, but I had to keep buying band aids to keep the shoe from rubbing. It became very uncomfortable and very expensive after all of the band aids I kept buying after buying a new pair of shoes! I also found the box of the shoe to be very uncomfortable. As replacements, I bought the Asics Gel-Kayano 17 and I love them! They are so comfortable!
