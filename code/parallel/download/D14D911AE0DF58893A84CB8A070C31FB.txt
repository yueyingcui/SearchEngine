Nike Zoom Streak 3
I bought this for my 9 year old who wears a size 8 in men. He loved it. He loves running so this shoe is very light, it's not like a regular sneaker that is heavy padded or protected in the front. It was designed for running so it's light and very breathable (helps with the stinky socks issue). He got a lot of compliments but I don't let him wear it every time because it looks pretty fragile (looks that way...time will tell with my kids). Because of the price, I bought it slightly larger because his feet grow quickly.
