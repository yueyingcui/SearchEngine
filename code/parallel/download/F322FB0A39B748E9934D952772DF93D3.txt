Saucony Originals Jazz Original W
I ordered the navy/silver ones, the silver is more metallic looking than in the picture, but I still love the look all the same! They are true to size, I didn't have to order up or down. I love the extra laces, and they're very comfy.
I bought this shoe after having surgery for a morton's neuroma, hoping it would be comfortable enough to stand for long periods of time for my job! And also hoping the toe box would be roomy enough. I read the reviews and decided to or a 1/2 size up. I normal wear an 8.5. That being said... I probably could have ordered my normal size, but I feel the toe box may have been a bit to narrow. So I am going to keep them. They are so comfortable. Might feet didn't hurt at the end of my shift. And I really love the pink color. I love the shoe! If you you're looking for a fun cute comfortable shoe I feel that's what you will get with this shoe.
I normally wear a 6½ to 7 in shoes (in Birkenstocks a 37R), I originally tried these in a 6½ and they were way too small. I then exchanged them for a 7 again too small, so I sized up to a 7½ and they are almost perfect. I have noticed this as a trend among athletic shoes lately that the sizes are at least half to a full size too small (use your actual foot measurement and go with the nearest larger size, you can always wear thicker socks, but you cannot shrink your feet. Anyway the style is smoking, they are cushy, comfortable breathable and have a really awesome funky retro vibe. They do not look like frankenshoes on, they make your feet look really small and they are really light weight. A real bonus is that they come in a ton of fun colors, so you can really funkify your wardrobe and are quality shoes at a price point I will not cry over.
I absolutely love these shoes. They are very light weight and super comfortable. The shoes do seem to run half a size larger. Besides that, I have no complaints. They are well worth the money!
