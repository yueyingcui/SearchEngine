New Balance Kids KJ480 (Toddler/Youth)
Fit was true to size. Son is 7 and this was the best shoe we have ever purchased. We have gone through Skechers within a couple of weeks over and over. At this age kids tend drag their feet more and more which chewed through his Skechers like butter. They are made very cheap and I was very surprised and elated that these shoes seemed to have been made with a sturdier rubber than other shoes. With the rubber on the toe extending further back over the top of the foot it helped prevent premature tearing and detaching. Due to the thicker rubber and sturdiness they are holding up much better than I thought. The tread on this shoe is also outstanding. This review is exactly one month to the date he started wearing the shoe and from what I can see there is hardly any wear showing on the toe. Others shoes by this time had already worn down to the inner layers of the toe fabric. The corded shoe laces are also a nice touch. They appear to be easy for him to tie and are built sturdy as well. I am sticking with this shoe and others built like it from now on. They do seem a tad heavier than other shoes but that doesn't seem to bother my son at all.
My son has owned numerous pairs of New Balance and usually the Wides fit him perfectly but in this style his heel slips out of the shoe (they seem to be the correct size in all other areas or else I would try another size). Even after tightening the laces there was no way to secure the heel. So unfortunately these are going back. Otherwise these would have been great. They are very well-made and a great value for the price.
