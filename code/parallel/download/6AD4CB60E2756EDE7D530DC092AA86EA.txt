Keen Voyageur
These run about half a size large. The attached tongue also creates a friction point on the top of my right foot even after adjustment. The shoes look good and has good lateral stability. They are heavy shoes with solid lacing. The arch support is fairly good for an off the shelf insert. If you have flat feet, you would probably still be well served to use an orthotic.... either custom or something like an Orthera.
Yes, I like this shoe. I walk every morning in wet grass and need waterproof shoes and these also last longer then your typical tennis shoe. They do run small so always order a half size larger. Keen heavy shoes like this run small.
Shoes arrived in just 3 days, The shoe itself very comfy, but run 1/2-1 size big for me, will re-order different size when receive credit. Thank you.
I was looking for shoes for light hiking, and decided to try these.  Ordered the size I wear, and they arrived quickly, and fit well.  I don't know if they are water proof, but wore them today after a deluge, walking through wet grass and some mud, and my feet stayed dry.
Great looking shoe. I think they are true to size, whereas another shoe I bought was small for the size ordered. I'm going to reorder a size that will fit.
This is my second pair of Keen shoes. I have the ericksons back packing and are not true to size like the voyageur. Check out my reveiw on them. I have no compaints about the voyageur but the insoles are junk. Buy a good pair of insoles and put the keen insoles in the trash.
