I wear these for Zumba and love the easy turning with the bottoms they have. The heel is a little wide but I lace my shoes to allow for that. I normally size up one full size in athletic shoes as was the case with this shoe. It is very attractive and stylish.

I am very pleased with this shoe, I did order a half size larger, like the other reviews had indicated, they fit perfect. I do Zumba twice a week and this shoe has made a huge difference. The balls of my feet feel so much better. I also have a large bunion, and the support on the sides helps with that too. They are a bit slippery, so I can't wear them for weight training class on the wood floor, but I bought them specifically for dance, so very pleased!
Comfy shoe, true to size. Great lateral support with the ability to tighten with velcro strap. However, within two weeks of Jazzercise workouts alone the bottom of shoe started to peel away. The lateral movements and dragging of feet quickly got the better of this shoe and now I have to be cautious to avoid tripping over the tag that flips on the bottom of the shoe. Very disappointed. :( Also, I would NOT suggest this shoe if you have large feet. This style makes your feet look huge. The extra length only exaggerates the angled velcro strip and then the off center lacings. (Yes, they are not straight, they are offset with the angle of the velcro piece. I didn't notice it on smaller size shoes from other people who had this shoe until I got it in my size 10.5. PS - no comment regarding arch support as I use custom orthodics.
I am not the greatest reviewer, but quick and to the point. True to size, Velcro across the toe bed is perfect because I need extra room. I bought these specifically for Step Classes. They are working out perfectly. 
I purchased these for Jazzercise and they are great. Love the fit, true to size and the comfort. Bought another pair in the pink color!
