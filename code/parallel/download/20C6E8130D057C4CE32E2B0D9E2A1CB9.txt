Allen-Edmonds Shelton
I bought these great looking shoes, but had to return them. As usual, Allen-Edmonds interpretation of size EEE (3E) is narrower than most other shoes available in widths. This is too narrow for my feet. Very uncomfortable. And only this price for the pain of a great look! Alternatively, Clarke, Drew, New Balance, Dunham, Alden, Florsheim, J&M and other reputable shoe companies truly make their extra-wide shoes extra-wide. Also, this shoe has the cushioning of sheet metal. For the price of the shoe, it is a complete disappointment (other than great style). Uncomfortable at any price.
Excellent fit. Fits similar to AE Leeds shoe. About 1/2 size larger (longer and wider) in same size than AE Grayson and Park Avenue. No problems with break in. Comments on first day worn as being very unique and handsome. This is my 6th pair of AE over last 10 years. All 6 still in regular rotation. Great products.
Best shoe for my husband's birthday present - 
I bought the shoes for my husband's birthday present and he loved them! The size is perfect, they feel really comfortable and go with all the clothes he wears.

Couldn't be better!
I hadn't had a pair of these since college. They look great and feel great! Love your website--especially the feature that allows me to see only the shoes that are available in my size and width.
