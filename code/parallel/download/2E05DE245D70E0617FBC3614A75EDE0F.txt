Converse Kids Chuck TaylorÂ® Chromatics (Toddler/Youth)
I bought these for my nephew. The shoe is so much fun and it changes color in the light. He loves them and his classmates want them too. The size runs a little big. And once again love the free next day delivery. 
FUN AND COLORFUL! The shoes get additional pink and yellow patches when exposed to sunlight. It takes quite a while for them to fade back to white, which my daughter found a tad disappointing; she was hoping for faster change. Still, she loves them and is very excited to put them on. These shoes run large. We originally ordered a size 3 and it was a full inch longer than a size 3 in another shoe (different brand). We then ordered half a size down, and the 2.5 is more narrow but really not much shorter. It's a basic shoe with very minimal arch support. But the patterns and color certainly make for a fun twist on a classic. Fun shoe!
