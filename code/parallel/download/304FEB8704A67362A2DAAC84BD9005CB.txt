Rockport ProWalker M7100
I was looking for a shoe that was comfortable to walk in but was somewhat "dressy". The Rockport ProWalker M7100 works well for that. I found it very comfortable and attractive. What I didn't expect was that it ran small - I normally wear a size 14, and sometimes 14s are a bit too big. Not here - I initially ordered 14 and they were too tight. A 15 fit - first time I have ever worn a 15. So my advice would be to order a size up from what you normally take.
This shoe used to have a soft sole and were a great shoe. But now they have a hard plastic sole. Everyone knows hard soles are terrible walking shoes except the moron working for Rockport now. These are made in USA so it's most likely a young kid that's educated beyond his intelligence. I bought a size 9 EEE and they are a perfect fit. Very nice looking shoe as were the older soft sole shoe. It'll probably take years before Rockport hires someone that understands shoes again. Until then, expect Rockports to have soles so hard they sound like cowboy boots walking down a hallway.
Normally size 7 M fits me exactly. These seem to run small, so a 7 1/2 M should be right on this model.
