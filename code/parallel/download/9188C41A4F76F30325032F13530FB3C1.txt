ASICS GEL-GameÂ® 3
Great service! Exactly what I ordered.  Can't go wrong with Asics Gel Game 3, comfortable with good support.  Found a half size larger fit best.
Blazing yellow is awesome. I use them as cross trainers and get lots of compliments. I play tennis twice a week. They are not top level shoes or the most durable. But the comfort and support are perfect for regular arches. If your size is borderline, go half a size up. They are narrow and slightly short. Otherwise they are highly recommended for occasional tennis players or as a great all around shoes.
Like other reviewers commented on and I didn't pay attention to, this shoe is narrow at the front and runs a half size small. 
I am a novice taking tennis lessons. It has been about 14 or so lessons, about 1-1.5 hour each. My running shoe (Asics Gel GT-2120) size is 9. This shoe size is 9.5 (ordered based on the review). Before starting to wear to the lessons (last 2-3 times), I wore the shoes for about 4-5 hours in hopes to break-in the shoes. That does not seem to have made a difference in terms of toe box expansion. While GT-2120 felt excellent since first trying out at the shop, "Game" has felt a bit narrow around the forefoot. Having written that, after wearing the shoes for about 5 minutes, shoe does not feel uncomfortable. I have not felt shoe to be hot during the lessons. The situation, feels like, may change while running around more. Currently I wear thin white socks. Seems like thicker socks (New Balance) won't be touching these any time soon.
Great shoes - very comfortable and great grip on the court. They run small so order a 1/2 size larger than usual. I play mainly on clay but some hard court and these seem to be holding up very well.
