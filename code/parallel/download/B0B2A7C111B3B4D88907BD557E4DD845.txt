Stride Rite SRT SM Foal (Infant/Toddler)
Great little shoes. I needed real support in a small size because my son is small but is starting to head towards walking and these fit the bill. I would say that they run a little smaller compared to the Nike 2.5 size I ordered - almost wish I would have just gotten a 3 but they will fit for a while at least!
These shoes were the perfect first shoe for my son. They are light weight and they are not bulky. He loved them so. I wish they made them in his current size!
I wanted shoes in a half size and these suit the purpose. They go with lots of outfits. Sometimes I worry that the ankle opening is too tight on my son's (regular-sized) ankles because I've seen a mark left there. But I'm satisfied.
