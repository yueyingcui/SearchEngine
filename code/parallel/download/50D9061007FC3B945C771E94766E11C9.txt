Mizuno 9-Spikeâ„¢ Watley G3 Switch
Needed new softball cleats after my old ones broke. Ordered these along with the Mizuno Finch Franchise 4 both in my usual size 8.5. The Finch's fit perfectly but the Watleys were at least a half size, to full size too big and super wide. Sorry to say the Watleys are going back. Highly recommend the Finch Franchise 4 though (plus they're cheaper!).
Excellent shoes. They feel true to size and my daughter loves them. They are well made and fit my daughter's wider foot nicely. Recommended.
This is my first pair of softball cleats.  I typically wear a size 7 in Nike, I had to go with a 6.5 for these Mizuno cleats.  Good support, does what I needed!
Perfect for my 10 year old daughter who plays softball.  Her foot size is about a 6 1/2 in normal ladies shoes.  She loves that you can switch out the color panel too.
My daughter measures a 6 1/2 womens, and her width is between a B and a C. The size 7 medium width fit her perfectly. 
This is the third softball season that she has worn Mizuno softball shoes. She has tried Nike brand, but found them to be too narrow.
