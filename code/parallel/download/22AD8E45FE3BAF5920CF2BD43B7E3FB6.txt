Biom Natural Motion by ECCO BIOM Lite 1.2 Ballerina
I was super excited about these shoes - I wanted something comfy and stylish to walk around San Francisco. I was so disappointed that these did not fit! I am a pretty standard size 12 medium. The sizing options said a 42 covered sizes 11-12. I was skeptical because normally, I would be a 43, which I always thought was the equivalent of 12 medium. Nevertheless, I ordered the 42 (not carried in a 43) really, really, really hoping the size chart on this shoe was correct. It was not. These shoes look so good and they feel as they would be super comfy if they weren't a size too small.
Very comfortable and go with almost everything! I'm usually a 38 or 38.5 in euro sizes but I needed a 39 in these.
These are nicely made shoes and were cute on; I wish they fit me better. The pair I received felt at least a full size larger than the usual European size I wear. I have a narrow heel and was concerned the fabric might stretch with wear and be too loose. Also they do not provide a lot of support for my very high arches.
