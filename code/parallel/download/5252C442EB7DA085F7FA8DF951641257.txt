Vans Eraâ„¢  Core Classics
These shoes are very comfortable.  I have wide size 14 feet, and they fit great.  The soles are not that thick and no arch support, but they are still good for everyday wear.
Just got these leather vans in the classic white. The white has a yellowish tint to me. I was also expecting them to be roomy in the toe, and that isn't the case. Haven't decided whether to keep or send back. Also the black stripe around them was scratched up due to packing. Sigh...Was really excited to get them. A little disappointed. I will say they are true to size I was just expecting them to be cut a little wider. The leather is nice as far as the feel of it and the sole was nice with a textured bottom. Delivery was quick.
