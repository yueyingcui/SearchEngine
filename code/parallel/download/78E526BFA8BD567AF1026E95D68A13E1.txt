Nike Golf Dunk NG
Finally a fun golf shoe!  If you like Nike Dunk sneakers, you will like this shoe, too.  Wide and cushiony like the originals!  I added an orthotic with no need to size up.
Awesome blend of Nike dunk style with golf show function. Totally waterproof. Probably a coincidence that the 4 rounds of golf I have played in these have also been my best 4 rounds of golf ever :). I originally went with a size 9 like my Nike Air Force 1's, but they felt too small in the toe-box. 9 1/2 were perfect.
These shoes are fun and stylish. I found them to run 1/2 size small. I love fun and different styles - most golf shoes are so boring and make your feet look larger than they are. Women deserve fashionable golf shoes as much as everyday wear! Thanks Nike!
Great looking shoe. Felt comfortable with the wide toe box. Unfortunately, they were a half size too big.
