PUMA Lab II FB
Nice comfortable shoes. Had a previous pair of Pumas (Suede Classic) that absolutely destroyed my feet upon first wearing. While I was eventually able to break those in, they were never very comfortable. The Lab II was comfortable from the beginning. In fact, I described them to a friend as like walking on clouds. I have spent entire days walking in them across different types of terrain and never had any issues. They look/feel about a half size longer than I normally expect from a size 12, but nothing to really remark about. They look good with a nice pair of slim jeans as well. My only concern will be how they hold up. The Suede Classics that I had before this had a worn out sole within 10 months of me purchasing them, which to me is unacceptable. I've only been wearing these for about a month, but no wear on the sole visible yet. Fingers crossed!
