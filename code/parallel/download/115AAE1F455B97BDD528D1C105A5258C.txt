New Balance MT810
Took these out for a four mile run and two hour hike last weekend. Fits true to size based on 10+ years of buying NB running shoes. Very comfortable and supportive, and felt good running/hiking on moderately rocky and root-filled terrain. Only complaint is that they feel a little heavy - most trail runners do I guess. Overall, I would definitely recommend for a reasonably-priced trail shoe.
I bought these in red, love how they look.  I always buy the same size in New Balance sneakers, a wide width 4E and they've alway been true to size, but these are a bit narrower than a 4E normally would be.  The shoe is so soft and comfy that I'll still wear them without trouble, just wish they were a tiny bit wider.
Just got these a week or so ago. Have been trying them tentatively. Seem to be pretty good; better than a $125 pair I tried at same time. I have a 9 4E foot and is hard to find fit. I love New Balance when they fit, but like another reviewer said, their consistency just isn't there. I can order the same size in the same last between 2 different shoes and it might as well be random. As the other reviewer said, even within same shoe, size can vary. All that said, I have decided these are a keeper. Cushion, Support, fit. Great ventilation - a "must have" for me. Got black/yellow. Wanted another color so I could easily alternate. Alas, the other combinations are not available in my size. Now stuck with having to hope it becomes available or go back to the crap shoot of ordering 7 or 8 pairs and finding one that fits as well as these. Sure wish they would continue a line for a while so I could simply re-order. I also wish they'd make a muted color combo - white/grey; etc.
These are great shoes. They provide the typical great New Balance quality. The fit is true to size and these are very comfortable lightweight shoes. There is plenty of cushioning with every step without them feeling too soft. I highly recommend these shoes.
