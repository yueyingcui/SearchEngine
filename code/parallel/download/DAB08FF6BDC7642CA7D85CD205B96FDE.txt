Converse Kids Chuck Taylor® All Star® Ox (Infant/Toddler)
These are great sneaks! I buy them all the time, however I have to go down two whole sizes because they are huge. My son is an 8 and I had to exchange twice until finally finding the 6 fits. Great colors and great style!
I ordered these for both of my sons and my nephew to wear in a wedding in a few months. They run very large, so I ended up ordering a second set in the size down. I think that they will be fine for everyday use, but there is really no support. I bought them mostly for the look.
These shoes are absolutely adorable on; however, they're more for style than comfort. There is no arch support (which is really important in a toddler's shoe) so I wouldn't suggest them for use every day. Also, they run about a half-size big.
