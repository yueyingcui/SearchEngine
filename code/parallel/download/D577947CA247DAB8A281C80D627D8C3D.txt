Keen Arcata Leather
I own several pairs of Keen shoes, and what I like best about them is the oversized, comfortable toe box.  This shoe does not have that!  The toe tapers right down and pinches relative to other size 11 Keens.  If you have a wide forefoot or a big toe that gets pinched down easily, order a half-size up or order a different shoe!
Purchased these shoes and am happy. The shoes look a bit bulkier in the picture and are quite thin yet comfortable in the sole. I wear a size 14 so I cant be all that picky. Overall I think they are a great shoe for the price. Comfortable and light. I actually love the retro bowling shoe look of these.
