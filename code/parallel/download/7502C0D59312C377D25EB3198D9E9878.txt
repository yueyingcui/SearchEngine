Puma Kids Tune Cat B V (Infant/Toddler/Youth)
I loved these shoes for my daughter but when I got them in, they were big. I find that they run big in size.
I bought these shoes to surprise my daughter. She absolutely loves these shoes. Her review of the shoes is they fit true to size, the color combo are amazing, and they grip like tires!
Not only are these shoes absolutely adorable, but they feet my baby\'s feet perfectly!  They do seem to run a little smaller than the typical shoe though, so I\'d suggest getting the next size up (for example, my daughter wears a toddler size 4, but we had to exchange for the size 5 because the 4\'s were almost too small).
