New Balance W790
These shoes are a great value. I needed a new pair of shoes for fitness and power walking. Also, I need wide shoes which are difficult to find something that is stylish and accommodating my size needs. These are comfortable and I love the bright color. Most importantly, the size is absolutely perfect-- finally a pair of wide shoes that are actually wide. My only compliant is the arch support is lacking.  I have high arches and bought some insoles to compensate for the gap.    
I usually like New Balance because of the wide sizes but these were too big. Not impressed at all and the color is almost a mucky grey tan. I also ordered the Nike Pegasus same size 9.5 wide and love them. Yes, they are more expensive but our feet are very important! Good luck.
