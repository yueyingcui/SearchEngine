Bloch Kids Annie Tyette Tap S0350G (Toddler/Youth)
Definitely get these! My 3 year old is a true size 9 and I ordered a 9.5 wide width. They fit her perfect with a little room to spare in the length for the dance season. There is a snap elastic band as well as a black ribbon to tie across. The tap in front and back are solid. Her face lit up when she put them on and she danced and shuffled and is very excited for her first tap class. Definitely would recommend.
These are great little tap shoes. I got them for my 4Â½ year old and she was thrilled to start tapping in them. I love that they have an elastic snap that secures them and then the laces to give it the traditional tap shoe feel. You can remove the laces but they do not bother us so we keep them on. My girl wears somewhere between a 10 and an 11 depending on the shoes so I went with the 11 so she would have room to grow. They are a good fit so I would say they probably run true to size.
We first ordered Capezio tap shoes, but even the wide size was extremely narrow. We exchanged them for the Bloch wide tap shoe and this is much truer to size. Our daughter loves them and we definitely plan to order them again as her foot grows.
My daughter normally wears a size 12.5m street shoe so I ordered a size bigger 13.5. Its a little bigger than what I would have liked but she will have plenty of room to grow. Don't feel the shoe is to narrow, the with about average. Also I agree with the other reviews, very cute and has the elastic where you tie the shoe so it stays on.
My 5 year old loves these. Her feet are wide so sometimes we have trouble finding specialty shoes. We ordered these in a wide width, she says they're comfortable and they seem to fit true to size. The bow is decorative, they actually close with a snap.
