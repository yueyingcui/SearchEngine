J-41 Tribal Barefoot
Ordered a 6, but shoes seem to run small. Exchanging them for 1/2 size bigger. Very cute.
These are the most comfortable shoes I own! Super cute and perfect for summer. I ordered my regular size (6.5) and they fit like a glove. Worth every penny. Will be purchasing more!
Love these shoes. They are very comfy, seem to fit true to size, the toe box roomy, not squished, they dry quickly and are actually kind of cute on. Highly recommend these.
The shore overall is very comfortable-all day comfortable! I did have to order a half size larger for true comfort. I would recommend these to anyone-comfort and style all in one!
This shoe is very comfortable, though I would recommend ordering a full size larger. Very light and great for narrow feet.
I found that these run a little tight, but kept the original size 9 and they have stretched enough to be comfortable, almost immediately.  Wore them all day with no break-in period required.  They are a little tough to get on with the elastic strap rather than a velcro-type closure, but I also have a wide foot, which probably accounts for that.   But once on, they are the most comfortable shoes that I own. All day comfort and stylish, too. Get compliments every time I wear them.
