Nike Free TR Fit 2 Print
Loved the blue so I got the red, a real great shoe. True to size, very comfortable and they look great, I got a lot of stares, very happy feet.
These shoes are very comfortable and light weight. I agree with the previous reviewer that these are true to size and the Winter Fit are a half size smaller (I have those as well). The pattern makes these very cute and different.
Love this sneaker. I have the Winter free fit. I ordered that a 1/2 size bigger. This mesh style runs true to size. The Winter satin runs a little small. You will live in this shoe!
