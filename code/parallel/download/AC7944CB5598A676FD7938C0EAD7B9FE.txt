New Balance Classics WL661
I am usually comfortable in a 6.5 US, and have had several other types of NB shoes in that size, but this one was surprisingly small. I returned it and ultimately chose another shoe, but it was very comfortable otherwise!
These sneakers are awesome. I use them for cardio kickboxing, HIIT (high intensity interval training), step class, sprint runs on the treadmill and the elliptical machine. Even my trainers comment on how lightweight they are during my movements. I ended up buying a half size larger than what I normally wear. My exact size was too snug and a whole size up was flopping off of my foot.
Beautiful shoes. Very light weight. Good quality construction. Buy a half size larger. 
Truly love these sneakers, extremely comfortable. I wear a size 7, but I purchased a 7.5 based on reviews - definitely need to get a half size larger than your normal size. Huge fan of these sneakers!
I love the look and feel of these shoes. I normally wear an 8N but an 8 1/2 B in NB shoes. In this model the 8 1/2 B was a half size too short! I had to return them.
Definitely go up half size. pretty comfy, but little to no arch or ankle support
I should have listened to the reviews that said to order 1/2 size up, but a 10-1/2 wasn't available so I had to send them back.  They were very lightweight and I think a larger size would have been fine.
They are so light. Hard to believe they give me support, but they do. I do not suggest using for step or jazzersice type classes. I'm glad I read the reviews about the size and ordered 1/2 larger.
Arrived quickly and I'm super excited! This shoe runs a little small eventhough I ordered a half size up which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. They felt great on my feet during my run. Great sneakers.
