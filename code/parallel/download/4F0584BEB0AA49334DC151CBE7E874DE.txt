K-Swiss Bigshotâ„¢ W
This is a great shoe. The colors are nice. The sole stiff and supportive for tennis. I really wanted a shoe with more mesh, less leather for circulation. My old K-Swiss made my feet so hot. These do the trick, pretty much. My one ding is that they are very wide in the toe box. I have a narrow foot and have to use the heel lock method of tying these in order to pull my heel back into the shoe. This leaves a lot of width in the toe box. If you have narrow feet, I would consider sizing down a half size.
