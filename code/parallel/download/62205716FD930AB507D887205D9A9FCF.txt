Timberland Youngstown
Made the mistake of ordering my "sneaker" size (9) instead of my "shoe" size (8.5).  Shoe size worked.  Not larger than marked, but roomy.  Laces around heel can be tightened to ensure heel doesn't come up.  Great look.
I have always worn New Balance or Dunham shoes, these Timberlands fit just like them, very true to size, and extremely well built. These shoes are rugged and styled very classically. I am extremely impressed with these shoes so far and hope to get year of use out of them. Very solid, very nice, would recommend to anyone.
It is hard to find good looking casual shoes in this size.
I like shoes and I have big feet. It is nice to find a stylish shoe in my size. The leather laces do not seem to become untied like others I have had the past. They are very comfortable, and I recommend them.

Size is Off.
I buy to my left foot which is a half size larger than my right foot. The left shoe fits perfectly, the right shoe is exactly the opposit of what it should be, it should be somewhat loose, but it fits a full size too small. I thought the shoe would stretch fine, It didn't.
