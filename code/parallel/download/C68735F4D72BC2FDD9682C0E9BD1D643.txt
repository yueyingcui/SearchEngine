Puma Kids Voltaic 3 V (Infant/Toddler/Youth)
My k grader loves these shoes. He thinks they are so fast and cool. I would prefer that the top wasn't mesh. It looks silly and is going to get really dirty. It's true you will need a size bigger. Overall we are happy with this shoe.
These run short and a little wider than normal for Puma's. My daughter has narrow feet and one foot is a size 13.5; the other foot is a size 1. We ordered a size 1 and they were both too short and too wide. Thank goodness for free shipping!
