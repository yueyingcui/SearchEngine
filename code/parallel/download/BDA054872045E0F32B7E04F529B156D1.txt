O'Neill Superfreak Tropical RT Boot
The reviews make it clear that there is a real sizing problem with these shoes, but since I wear size 12 and another reviewer ordered size 12 and received a shoe that fit, I thought maybe the 12's are correct. Wrong. Although the shoes I received were labeled "US Size 12" they were literally 2 inches shorter than my foot. Crazy. Only order these shoes if you're feeling really lucky.
Having used O'Neill Split Toe boots for many years for surfing, the Round Toe (RT) is a nice change. Seems true to size despite what the description says.
Due to the description I also ordered a size smaller, in Men's I'm a size 7 so I ordered a size 6. They were tiny! Like at least 3 or 4 sizes smaller. A kid's size! I'm really confused now. I think they had to be miss-marked at the factory. Other than that I like the feel of the shoe, in my hands, and it looks nice. My only complaint would be I wish it had a lower cut but then they might get pulled off in the surf. I am going to reorder a size 9, like the woman who reviewed them earlier did and hope they are actually the size of a man's 6.
I wear a size 10 shoe normally, and I ordered a size 10 here and it fit well. The sole is quite thin so you can definitely still feel rocks, etc. The Speedo models have a thicker sole.
Are you kidding me? Order 3 sizes larger than your size!! They don't have women’s so I ordered myself a men’s size 6 (I'm a size 8.5) and they ended up fitting my NINE YEAR OLD who is a size 4 Youth. So I ended up keeping the men’s size 10 I ordered for my husband which fit fine. And I plan on ordering him a size 13 since he's a size 10. The sizing is WAY off kilter on these shoes. But they are nicely made.

My husband loves these water shoes!  He uses them for swimming and playing volleyball in the wet sand.  Make sure to go down half size.
