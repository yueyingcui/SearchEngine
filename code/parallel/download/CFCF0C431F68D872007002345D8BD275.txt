Grenade Standard Isshoe
I wear a size 13 and have flat feet. The shoe was a bit too small for me around the toe and pretty narrow. I love the design of them though. I'm upset I couldn't get a bigger size.
Really light/thin. But great considering the price. Like Vans, but with a Grenade. Probably won't last long on my size 13's but no shoe ever does. You're getting what you pay for and a first-day compliment, too!
I can't stop getting compliments on these shoes! Very good looking, but not the most comfortable things to wear. These really do feel a full size too big. I normally wear 11 and I got a 10.5, but still felt a little big. Overall, great shoes.

The size 12 ran small, so I exchanged them for a different shoe. Customer service was extremely friendly and helpful!
I bought these guys for a slipper/skate kind of shoe. Awesome for slipping on and quickly getting out of the house. As for the skating it has a good feel, I find that the shoes give me more control on my board. I think they look good (I have the black ones). Now, if you have the luxury of being able to go to a store and buy them do that. I had to buy them online and when I received them I notice they fit me a little big. I did not want to go through the process of sending them back, so I rolled with what I got. I wear a lot of Circa shoes size 11.0 and I ordered the Grenades in a 10.5 and they still felt big. In conclusion get a full size smaller, even though they fit a little big I still like them.
