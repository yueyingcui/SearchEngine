OluKai Kia'I Trainer
Lightweight and comfortable. OluKai is fast becoming my go to brand for all things footwear related. All day wear, standing and walking miles and miles, my feet feel fine. These took about a day or two to break in the footbed. Also run slightly small. Ordered my normal size at first and they would only fit if barefoot. Went 1/2 size up and all is perfect.
I didn't know this brand until I tried the Moloa on in a store and experienced extreme comfort! I needed some athletic shoes though, so I looked to see if they made something and found this trainer. It's also extremely comfortable. I usually wear a 12-13 and had to order the 14. I never ordered that size before, so they run very small. I'm very happy with these and they are so comfortable...and look really nice too!
