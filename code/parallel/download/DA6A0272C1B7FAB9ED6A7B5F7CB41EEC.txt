It looks great (love the thin sole). It's lightweight, fits well (though I need a size larger than I usually take for a good fit). The price is good for the value. I am a bit disappointed with the color fading over time. I purchased the green/white combo, and within two months, it faded substantially. I put them through the wash (post fade, and probably not in line with the manufacturer's recommendations) and the arch support (which is a heavy paper) came apart. I thought the glued on sole would give out, but so far it's kept up well. 
Owned about a month. Pretty happy with them. At first they felt my heel was sitting kind of off the inside edge of the heel of the shoe, but as they wore in, that went away. I bought a size 11, which fits the same as my old Puma Speed Cat size 11.5.
