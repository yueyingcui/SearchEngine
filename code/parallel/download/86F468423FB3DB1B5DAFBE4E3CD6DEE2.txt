Habitat Lark
These are good looking shoes...compact with a nice shape. They are, however, narrow in the toe area. It took about a week of squished toes to wear them in. It also took bit to get used to skating in them as I'm used to rounder/thicker shoes. But I've been very happy with Habitat shoes thus far with how they look and skate. The last pair I had were cupsole and they were great...good board feel and durability. These are vulcanized so we'll see how long they last. I would suggest getting a size up to save your toes some uncomfort, unless you have narrow feet.
