New Balance MW812
Most uncomfortable shoe I have ever owned - returned. Felt like I was wearing them on the wrong feet! I even ordered 1/2 size larger than I wear.
I was in search of a walking shoe to take the place of the Reebok walking shoes that I finally wore out. The new Reebok walkers were way to stiff (hard walking), and not nearly as comfortable as the New Balance MW812 model. Since I was replacing the Reebok's I had in three different colors, (white, black, and bone), I purchased the New Balance in all three colors. Very few walkers come in bone, which is actually beige in color. The New Balance MW812 are comfortable, keeps your foot very stable specially if you enjoy walking at a swift pace, and can be worn for several hours without any discomfort. This particular shoe is also stylish and not bulky looking. I normally wear a size 11 or 11 1/2, and with this particular style, the 11 1/2 was more comfortable. This model shoe costs more than there competitors, but it was worth it. I tried four (4) other brands before I selected the New Balance MW812 model. If you are looking for a good all around walking/touring shoe, I believe you have found the right one with the New Balance MW812. I hope this review was of value to you. Happy trails!
