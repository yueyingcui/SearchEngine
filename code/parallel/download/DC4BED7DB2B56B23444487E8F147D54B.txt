New Balance Classics W574
Extremely confortable and the first shoe I've tried on in a long time that was true to size and ready to go out of the box.  Highly recommend if you want a great walking shoe. 
Very handsome shoes. I take size 6 and the left shoe was just a tad too small near the big toe (but not by so much that I'd return the shoes.)Heavy socks are helping me break the left shoe in. I enjoy  working out wearing the shoes.
I love these shoes. I wouldn't use these shoes for running but they work well for walking at work. I love the crisp blue color. I'd be careful in ordering the size. I typically wear 7 1/2 - 8 and this shoe in an 8 is snug.
I love these shoes! The most comfortable sneakers I ever owned (beside my running shoes which are great but well...for running). I walk a lot and ride my bicycle to get to work and they are just perfect for that. After reading a couple of earlier reviewers I got 1/2 a size larger than I normally get and it fits perfectly. Also, I think they are kind of cute (I got the red ones).
This is the best shoe ever made. I have problem feet, and with this shoe I never have trouble. Over the years I've had at least half-a-dozen pairs and am ordering another. I wish the half-sizes came in more colors, but I'll settle for what I can get. I tried the 577 recently. It's not bad, but the leather is kind of stiff and the shoe just doesn't compare to the 574. As with all NB shoes I order a half size up from my regular.
