Reebok RealFlex Optimal
I have never worn a running or cross training shoe that has been as comfortable as this RealFlex Optimal. While the shoe tends to run on the narrow side (I am a top heavy man with wider feet), the material that makes up the sidewalls of the shoes is pleasantly stretchy. It gives enough to ensure comfort, but not enough that the shoe becomes unstable. My feet pleasantly stretch beyond the edges of the sole instead of being packed in like a few days extra clothing in a vacation suitcase. The sole is phenomenal, and gives great support and bounce. I marked the shoe as running a bit on the big side because I usually buy skate shoes (due to the aforementioned wide-feet issue) and they tend to run about a size smaller than advertised. Just fair warning in case any one else makes the jump from skate to trainer. The only major problem I have with the shoe is it is unstable for lateral movement. These are certainly not shoes you would want to take on the basketball court, or any other event involving doing anything but going forwards. Overall, I would highly recommend these from the emerging "barefoot" running shoe market.
Best athletic shoes I've owned. They are lightweight and very breathable. I have read other reviews saying things about sizing being off by a 1/2 to a full size but I had no problem with that. My feet are a little wider than the sole of the shoe allows but after a few days at the gym they stretched out enough to be the only shoe I want to ever wear again. I plan on buying more RealFlex models in a variety of colors.
