Stride Rite SRT SM Elmo (Infant/Toddler)
These shoes are great! They are flexible, comfortable for my 14 month old son, and easy to put on. They are also super cute - we get a lot of compliments. These are the first pair of shoes that my son has not only tolerated but loves! He loves to wear them and gets excited when we put it on him. The shoes are flexible enough for the early walker, but the sole is durable enough to protect his feet. We plan on getting another pair when he outgrows this size. 
My son absolutely loves these shoes. Every time he puts them on his face lights up. Was a great buy. Wish they came in bigger sizes so I could buy him another pair.
My 12-month old child loves the Elmo shoes. These are very comfortable and they look good. We bought size 5.5, so there is some space for growing. I do not understand why they call them boyâ€™s shoes though; my daughter loves Elmo very much! And the red color is perfect for little girls, too!
