Nike Zoom Rival S 6
The shoes arrived in a very timely manner and my daughter was quite pleased with how they looked. Unfortunately, they run very small and did not fit, so we returned them for a full refund and ordered another pair two and half sizes larger. The new pair came the next day and fit perfectly. My full refund was credited to my account within about 10 days as promised. Just know when you order this particular shoe that they run very small. We originally ordered a woman's size 8.5 and wound up with a 10 fitting just fine.
