New Balance WT626
Love the color of the shoe! It fits true to size (I wear an 11W) - definitely wide enough for my foot, although at first I wasn't sure if I had enough room for my toes. I just tied my shoes tighter and now my foot doesn't slip and hit the end of the shoe. I'm a nurse and work 12 hour shifts - my feet donâ€™t hurt anymore because it has great support! Very happy with this shoe.
