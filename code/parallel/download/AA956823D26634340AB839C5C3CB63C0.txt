TIC TAC TOES Sylvia
Wonderful shoe for dancing.  I usually wear a size 8, medium width, but in this case a 7 1/2, narrow, fit perfectly.
I got these shoes for my line dancing class. They are wonderful. They are light, comfortable and really cute, cute enough to wear for any occasion! They don't have an arch support so I put a small one inside and they are perfect. I have narrow feet and they fit well, true to size.
This is a nice little shoe. It is fairly comfortable (a little irritation at the back of the heel but most shoes need some breaking in) and cute. There is not much arch support. Most of the time I would order a 5.5 but the smallest size this came in was a 6 and it fit, so I would order a half size up.
