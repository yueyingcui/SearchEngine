ECCO Golf Biom Golf  Women's
Wow! I have never found golf shoes to be very comfortable, but these are the best! I bought these shoes primarily to walk the course and although I haven't walked 18 holes yet, I know these are going to be great. Comfortable right out of the box. They are extremely well made and I hope they last for a very long time as I have NEVER paid this much for any shoe. But I think they are worth every penny. They are true to size.
One of the best golf shoes ever! Super soft right out of the box, but provides plenty of support! Low to the ground - provides plenty of stability. Fit is slightly snugger than other Ecco models but not so different to require a larger size - to to its European sizing - size 39 fits an 8-8.5 perfectly. Requires zero break in - go play! Have fun! And remember your best golf is ahead of you!
These are absolutely the best golf shoes I've ever owned!  Soft as butter!  Lots of comments about how good looking they are. If in doubt about euro size choose smaller.  I where 7 1/2 shoe but 8 athletic. I bought 38 first but had to return for 37. Snazzy shoe!
The shoes are excellent. I tried it and are comfortable. However, they felt very weird at the back; I am half size and I was unable to keep it. I ordered 8.5 and they did not fit (very small). I reordered size 9 and, surprise, they run 9/9.5. They were quite big for me.
