New Balance Classics M373
New Balance doesn't disappoint for large feet! My husband wears a size 14 and has a mediumish or slightly narrow foot. New Balance is his go-to sneaker brand, they fit true to size and hold up well with heavy use.
The item in all as pictured and described except this is a very narrow shoe. For guys who in general have normal and wide feet, this is like a 10-year width for size 10 (size that I ordered).
I purchased this in silver. Comfortable, good arch support, easy to walk in. True to size.
