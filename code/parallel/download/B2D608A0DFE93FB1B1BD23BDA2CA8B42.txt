PUMA Esito Finale IT
I bought a size 11 because I heard that they were narrow. I am usually a size 10 1/2 or eleven, but those were to small so I returned them and got a size twelve. Those are still a little snug on the sides so I would say buy them at least a size larger.
I read everybody's opinion and they all say the same thing about the size. Well, so I ordered mine a size bigger and, yes, they were right. They come small size but thanks to this reviews I got mine and they fit perfect. So order yours one size bigger. Trust me.
Nice sneakers. Sold design. The only issue is that they come in a small size so order one size higher. I ordered 11 which is what I normally wear and had to return them. I ordered a size 12 which finally fit. 
Great shoes. Inexpensive. Quality. Look great. Comfortable. Liked them so much I bought a second pair in black. Only con would be that you need to order a 1/2 size larger than usual.
