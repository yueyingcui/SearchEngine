adidas Golf TOUR360 ATV
These shoes ran a bit large and I had to exchange them for a 1/2 size smaller.  Overall, these shoes are very comfortable and they keep my feet dry.  My only issue is the shoe laces seem to be very cheap and need to be more substantial.
Awesome golf shoes. I bought these to walk 9 holes every night, and they are certainly up to the task...great support combined with cushion (but not sloppy feeling). I'll always own at least one pair of Footjoy Icons (used to be the Classics), but wanted to add an additional shoe in order to give my feet a break since I play/hit balls every day. Unlike one of the other reviews that said these run a full size small compared to a Nike or a Footjoy, I found they run just a half size smaller. I normally wear an 8, so ordered a 9 (based on that other review), but had to return it for an 8.5 which fits perfect.
These are very comfortable shoes and worth the price. It's amazing what they do for my game too... just kidding. The sizes do run a bit bigger than what I was used to... I am usually a 10 1/2, and ordered an 11 1/2 and they fit perfect!
