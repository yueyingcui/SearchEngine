SKECHERS Stride-Next Step
I bought these for a Zumba class and they worked out nicely and are really comfortable. I read in the previous review that they run small so I went ahead and ordered them a half size too big. It turns out I didn't need the half size too big, but they still fit just fine. I buy another pair if I needed new tennis shoes again.
They are really cute! However I recommend a bigger size then what you originally wear because my sneakers fit me little small. And I ordered them a size 5!
