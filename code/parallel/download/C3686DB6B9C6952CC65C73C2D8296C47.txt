Merrell Kids Skyjumper MJ (Infant/Toddler)
I really tried to make these work for my daughter, but after three different sizes, it just wasn't meant to be.  The shoes are cute and comfy enough, but seem to run big.  I like that they come in half sizes, but we started with a 5, and then a 4 1/2 but her heel kept slipping out even with a heel cushion.  Went down to a 4 which seemed to solve the heel issue, but then she didn't like the feel of the shoe on her foot.  They seemed clunky.  Will keep looking for my picky shoe-wearer.
