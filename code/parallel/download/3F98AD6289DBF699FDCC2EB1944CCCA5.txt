Circa Drifter
This *RUNS SMALL*. Vans fit me perfectly at size 9 1/2. But a size 9 1/2 Circa Drifter is smaller than a Vans size 9! I'm hoping that a size 10 will fit. Otherwise, it seems like a sturdy shoe with quality construction. 

This runs about a full size smaller than listed, and are not fit for heavy skate use. It's a good looking shoe though.

My son loves these shoes. Since he is a size 15, it is just about impossible to get shoes in stores. We were able to find them here, and get them shipped free. And, they fit!
