Saucony ProGridâ„¢ Echelon 2
Bought these for my husband to use as a walking shoe. He was very pleased. Comfortable and true to size. 
I was a bit disappointed with the width in the toe box.  I purchased this shoe because I heard from other runners that the toe box width was generous as compared to others.  Since I wear wide sizes in Brooks and Mizuno I was comfortable in ordering 2E in size 11.  Needless to say the are a bit snug but will suffice for a training shoe they just didn't meet my expectations.
A very comfortable shoe. 
I have low arch in my left foot, and a flat right foot with wide, rectangle-shaped feet. My perfect size is 13 1/2 EE, but Saucony does not make that size. 
The 13 EE seems comfortable to me. The Brooks Dyad 14 EE is tight on me where the Saucony Echelon 2 13 EE seems to fit better. 
To me, it is more comfortable than the Dyad, but that's me.
