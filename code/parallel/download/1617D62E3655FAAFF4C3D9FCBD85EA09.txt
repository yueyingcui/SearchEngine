Drew Athena
I am truly sorry to say that I do not like these sneakers at all. They are not soft or cushiony but have very hard soles. I ordered size 8 but they seem to be very snug and too tight. I wore them for two days at work, I am a hair dresser, so I did not feel like I could return them. I have been trying everything to make them more comfortable. I even bought new soft cushion insoles to help for comfort but that makes them even tighter. They are way too expensive for me to be unhappy with but that certainly is the case. This is the first time that I have ever bought Drew sneakers so, I guess, I will go back to my Reeboks after this.
These shoes are well worth the money.  After 18 months of continuous foot and knee issues from plantar fasciitis, a torn meniscus, and early arthritis, to a spontaneous stress fracture I can't tell you how happy I am to have shoes that fit well and don't create any new issues!  I bought the WW in my normal size 10 for the extra toe room and they are just right.
