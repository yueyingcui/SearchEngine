These shoes look super cute online however when I received them I was not happy with the amount of gray coloring on the tongue and around the top and bottom of the shoe. I guess I didn't pay enough attention to that in the pictures. Also, I did not think these were comfortable at all. Even wearing them around the house for a few mintues, I knew they would not work for running or even walking long distances. There's very limited arch support. The size and width were fine. I ordered a 7.5 and if I could have kept them they would have worked fine in that area and I have wide feet. Unfortuantely, I had to return them just as soon as I got them. 
Love these shoes! Have only worn them at the fitness center but my feet ached every night after going to the gym in my old Skechers, until I put these on and no need to break in. Great for running on treadmill. Lots of cushion. True to size. Plenty of toe room. My feet haven't felt so good! Fast shipping! Ordered them late on a Thursday, and cause of the weekend, received them Monday.
