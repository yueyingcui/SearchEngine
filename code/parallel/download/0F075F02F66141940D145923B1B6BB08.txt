Hoka One One Mafate
These are so comfortable they should be illegal. They are so soft, cushioned, and easy on the joints. Invented by ultra distance runners, these help people with aches and pains run, and recover faster, and those without pain stay that way. I've been running for almost 30 years, and I'll never go back to Nike's, Saucony's, Asics, Brooks, New Balance. They don't even come close to the comfort of these incredible shoes. I own a pair of Bondi B's as well. So far, they've held up very well, 300 miles on the Bondi's, and 400 on the Mafate and still miles to go. They are sized like Nikes, run a little small.
