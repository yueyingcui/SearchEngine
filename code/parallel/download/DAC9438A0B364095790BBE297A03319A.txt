Ryka Studio D Mid
This is a good shoe for Zumba.  It is comfortable and turns and slides well.  Also gives good ankle support.  Unfortunately, for me, it was not enough to properly support my weak left ankle.  And though true to size, it was a little tight for my wide toes. Returned to Ryka Downbeat which is perfect for my ankle needs and works well with Zumba.
This is a great shoe for Zumba but, as another reviewer mentioned, it runs very short. I ordered a size larger than my shoe size, but since I put an extra insole in the shoe and wear cushioned socks, I should have ordered up a size and a half.
Love these shoes. 3rd pair I've had. They run small. I usually wear size 8 (8.5 in other athletic shoes), but wear a 9 in these.
