Regarding some of the coments about size. Put the sandal on with straps undone, push your foot all the way back to the heel, tighten the straps and your foot will stay in place.
I found the sizing the same as my other European size shoes.  These shoes are very comfortable and I can wear them when I really need to walk alot.  I even wore them to the Living Desert Museum in Palm Springs although I did pick up a little sand. Be sure to get the front velcro tight enough and then leave it alone. When it is wrong the shoe will rub.   
I really wanted to find a pair of these I could keep, because they are cute, comfortable, and so extremely adjustable. Alas, all three sizes I tried (my normal size, a half size up, and a full size up) all had problems. With my normal size and the one half up my toes hung over the front, but the shoe otherwise fit beautifully. With the full size up my toes just fit on the front of the shoe, but the back strap scraped against my ankle bone each time I stepped. So all had to go back. Too bad.
These are absolutely beautiful out of the box.  They  look very expensive and feel great.    The sizing was a tad bit off, meaning small, so I've ordered the next size up as I fell in love with them.  I am age 60 but think and act young and love to dance.  You could do it in these shoes.
