Avia Avi-Quest/A2545W
I really like this shoe! I also ordered a pair of Avias at the same time that were positively reviewed. While they are nice enough, I could immediately tell that the Avi-quest shoe was worth every penny of the price difference. They felt comfortable from the moment I tried them on. I wore them for two 5K walks over the first weekend that I had them and my feet, knees, and legs felt fine. In the past, I've suffered from plantar fasciitis, so I'm careful in my shoe selection. From reading the reviews, it seems that the brand typically has a wide toe box, which is definitely the case with these. I ordered my normal shoe size (8) and could easily stretch my toes out inside of the shoe. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, these shoes look terrific. They are cuter than the picture.
This shoe provides great arch support, and is overall an incredible shoe. Although it is true to size in length, it was a little wider on my foot than expected. I have a very narrow foot but is not usually a problem with sneakers since the laces can be tightened up. It did not work with this shoe so I had to send them back, however, if not for this, I would have kept them. The color is beautiful and unusua, kind of a salmon pink/coral.
