Merrell Moab Mid Waterproof
Very comfortable mid boot. Some Merrell waterproof boots feel heavy and bulky but these are great. Feel just like my Moab non waterproof low cut. Buy 1/2 size larger than normal.
I ordered these manly boots and they are perfect. They run true to my size. They are also snug and comfortable. Let's see if they are really waterproof.
Way too tight. These things are very snug, too snug if you ask me. Based on reviews I had read on the net I called & asked if these ran small, long, etc. I was told "true to size". No way, no how. I will try to buy a full size bigger but my standard size that I've worn in everything from cowboy boots to flip flops is 8.5. These are too tight.
Nice shoe. Good ankle support. Fit my very wide and tall 4E foot well. My big toe bumped into the front, so I have to go a half size bigger.
Amazon handled my order perfectly and the shoes were on sale, last ones in my size. But the left shoe front toe are was not flat as the right shoe was. I didn't want to send back, after wearing them the left shoe toe area is okay, not the same as the right shoe.
