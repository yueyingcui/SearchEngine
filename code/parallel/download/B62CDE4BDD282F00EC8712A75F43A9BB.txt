Avia Avi-Release Zero - A5305W 
I have a great pair of running shoes, but needed a pair for cardio classes at the gym. These are definitely much lighter than my running shoes. I never had any trouble with blisters. They felt true to size. Arch support isn't as much as my running sneakers, but maybe they aren't supposed to be quite as solid. They have held up great in a class with a lot of impact.
I had a pair of Avia sneakers that I loved, so I ordered these in the same size. Just as comfortable as the ones I had. I love them. The tread is easy to clean out also. It's also a very light weight sneaker which I like. The mesh is very breathable. Some other brands of woman's sneakers are too tight, but these are comfortable with a pair of athletic socks. I take a size 11 and they help make my feet look smaller. :)
