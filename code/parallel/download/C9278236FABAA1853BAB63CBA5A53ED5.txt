Puma Kids G Vilas 2 V Kids (Infant/Toddler/Youth)
My son loves these shoes. They work extremely well with his uniform. I would buy them a size larger next time around. Overall we are pleased with the quality of the product.
Bought these for my very active 3 year old and they are already falling apart.  They also run very large.  My son has large feet for his size, but these seem an entire size larger.  Needless to say, his next pair of sneakers will not be Pumas.
