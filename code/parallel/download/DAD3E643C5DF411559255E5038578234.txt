Dockers Castaway
Despite being labeled Wide, the shoe itself is narrow, and splays when the foot is inserted. Going up a half size improved the way the shoe looked (in my opinion).
Shoes are comfy, look great and were a good deal. My normal size 9.5 fit perfect and as usual shipping was lightning fast!
Bought for my husband in a 9.5 (he insists that's his size) but ended up exchanging for the 10. Nice looking shoe needs to break in a bit. Would buy again.
I brought these shoes for my husband who wears size 12, but lately when we go to shoe carnival he has to go up a 1/2 size or 1 size larger these were perfect
Fast delivery, good price, and good shoes! Best of all for me is that it finally hit me that my sore big toe joint (left foot) might be caused by the usual "N" size width -- I ordered "W" -- wonderful! Big toe and I are happy.
These were actually a gift for my nephew but he did tell me that he loved them and they are true to size and very comfortable.
