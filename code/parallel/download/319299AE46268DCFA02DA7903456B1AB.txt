PUMA El Rey Cross Perf L
I bought these as a gift for my son. They look great on him and he says they feel great. He wears a size 13 and these did not make his feet look huge like some shoes have a tendency to do!
I love these shoes. I bought them in black with grey strap. I wear a size 12 and they fit very well. I wear them with my grey sweater and dark jeans. It's a very clean look.
Rather tight across the top of foot and they run a half to a whole size small. Nice looking shoe, though not for me due to overall fit.
Honestly, these shoes get tons of looks, and feel great, but I had two major issues with them. 
First of all, breaking them in was difficult. Even though they were the right size, the back is leather, and took a week or so before it fit the shape of my foot. It was painful to walk in them for that week. 
Secondly, I am disappointed that the insole came apart within the first month. I ended up having to rip it out and get insoles - just seems like they weren't quality insoles from the beginning.

Awesomely comfortable. This has made me a fan of Puma! 
I have bought three more Pumas since. Get a half size larger though; they tend to run a bit small.

Perhaps it's slightly over-sized, but not enough to cause an issue. The leather is very comfortable.
