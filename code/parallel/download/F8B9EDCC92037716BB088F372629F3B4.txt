Osiris NYC83 Mid
I bought these shoes for my son! He loves them! And remember to buy these shoes one size bigger! My son is an eight and I ordered a nine for him because I saw that the shoe was really cushioned!  And shipping is super fast, order today and recieve tomorrow. And also if they don't fit,  you return it back and its free shiooing both ways, , which is awesome!

The sneakers were a Christmas gift for my grandson. I was not positive of the size. The man I spoke with was extremely helpful and suggested sending the sneakers with one day delivery at no charge just to be sure of size. That way, we would have what we needed in time for Christmas. The sneakers were just what he wanted.
Super comfortable awesome shoe for boarding, doesn't slip off my board even when wet. Good for any weather; that doesn't mean go jump in a puddle but they are great. Just get 1/2-1 size bigger than normal because they run small. But great shoe!
I have to say that these are the most comfortable sneaks I've had in years . I also have been wearing them to work & they have a ton of heel support (I tend to go through heels on my shoes rather quickly) . I am not exactly crazy about the style of these , probably would have picked a different one if it was here in my size . Also I followed others opinions & ordered a half size bigger then normal, & they fit perfectly . So go up a half size or so if you do .
Nice shoes. Cool design + neutral brown colors = awesome style. Definitely order 1/2-1 size bigger. I ordered 10.5 when I had another pair of Osiris 10.5's and these were way too small. Iâ€™m gonna try the 11's. very wide at the heel and ankle. Tons of cushioning (one of the trademarks of Osiris). Narrows at the toe, but shouldn't be a problem if you get the correct size.
