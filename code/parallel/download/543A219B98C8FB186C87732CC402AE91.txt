adidas Originals Kids Superstar 2 H&L (Infant/Toddler)
These are the only shoes that fit my son's feet properly.  I've ordered the navy stripe  over and over again in bigger sizes.  I'm disappointed that the size he needs next has been out of stock for quite some time.  
This sneaker did not work well at all for my son\'s narrow feet. At their tightest there was still tons of room around his foot and major heel slippage. We measured his foot against the insert and confirmed that it was the right size length-wise so I don\'t recommend this shoe for narrow-medium feet.
