adidas Originals Kids Samba (Toddler/Youth)
Love these shoes. My son is 5, & they are extremely cool shoes. This color is the best. I will be buying the next size up as soon as needed. My son has very wide feet, so he wears skate shoes a lot. But these fit, and are a great addition.
These shoes look great but they are very narrow. My son has very narrow and skinny feet and I still ordered a half size up to give him some more room.
