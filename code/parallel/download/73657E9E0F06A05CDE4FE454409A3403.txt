Nike Kids Jr Nike5 Gato (Toddler/Youth)
Fit true to size. My son loves these. Comfortable from the first time he wore them.
Sneakers were a perfect fit! My son measures at 13 and 1/2 and they were very true to size! Shipping was super fast too!
My 8 year old soccer playing daughter received these shoes as a Christmas gift and she absolutely loved them. They look great. The blue is very bright! She says they are very comfortable and she is rather picky. They are very well made and the size seems very accurate. We are very pleased with the shoes and would highly recommend them to others.
These shoes are fast, according to my son! They're great for indoor soccer, fit true to size, and are well built (re-enforced toe)!

I bought these shoes for my 5 year old when going back to school recently. I have to say that these shoes look fresh! On top of that he tells me they are comfortable and has opted to wear these over other shoes that he has. The only downside that I encountered was the fact that sometimes I do have to double knot because he does not know how to tie his laces yet. It would be great if Nike came out with a velcro version of these but other than that there is really nothing else to complain about. I like that my son is probably the only kid at his school to rock these! And it adds a little flair to the boring school uniform he has to wear! The fit is great especially since his feet are a little flat. In my opinion they are true to size. I'm glad we found a pair of shoes that he actually wants to wear!
