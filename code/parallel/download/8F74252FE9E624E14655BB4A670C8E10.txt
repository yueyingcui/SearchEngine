adidas Originals Kids Samoa (Youth)
I love this classic shoe. I wish they would make more classic shoes. The one exception to this shoe is the tongue. It is huge and comes above the top of the shoe so that it rubs on the lower leg. I hope that over time it does not bother my very picky fourth grader daughter. They feel true to size. They are wide enough for a normal foot. They should last a while before they start to look battered and tired. Which is a must for shoes.
Either my daughter's foot has changed, or the sizing of this shoe has changed.  She loved them in size 3.5, but they are too narrow in 4.0, and 4.5 is too long.  Bummer--she wore these every day.
Great casual shoe. My 10 year old son loves it. This is the second pair. 
True to size and he seems to find it very comfortable.
