OluKai Kamuela
Recently received my 3rd pair of Kamuelas and I continue to be impressed. The older versions tend to break in a bit quicker, but I didn't have any problems with this pair right out of the box. I tried some of the sandals and had size issues, but these are true to size. The nero color is their 'black' replacement and while it is more of a blue, it works well with any color of jeans.
These shoes come out of the box stiff around the ankles and take up to a week to loosen up, but that is pretty much the case with any boots or above-ankle shoes. they are every bit as stylish as you hope they will be. There is a tattoo like marking on the outside rear, but it is very subtle in the nero color which is essentially black. We will see how long they old up, but I am very satisfied after a week. I had to return the first pair and order half a size larger than usual.
Pros: Fits just like their sandals. So if you own their sandals, get the same size. Wide toe area is great for folks with wide feet. Shoe design is awesome. I like the tattoo accent. Shoe construction is excellent. Foot bed is extremely comfortable. Cons: The tattoo accent is purely decorative. It is "inspired" by Polynesian tattoo styles but it does not use any of the traditional symbols. Sides are high and tend to push against ankles.
Fits like a wide size 14 will. Perfect - because putting in an additional insert makes it fit extremely well.
Love them. They do run big - a half to full size!

These shoes are very comformtable like any of the shoes or sandals by Olukai that I've purchased.  They run a half-size larger than marked, I typically wear an 11.5 but take a 12 in these shoes.  They also feel a bit wide at first, but that is how they are designed.  I actually like the additional width and toe room, and it doesn't cause any rubbing problems or issues with mobility or walking performance.
