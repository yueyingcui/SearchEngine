Avia A5643W
I have found this to be the most comfortable style of Avia shoes for walking.  They are incredibly lightweight and fit my feet perfectly in my usual size.  Not sure if they would provide quite enough support for running. I have two pairs and love them!  
I love these shoes! They are great for running, cross training, anything fitness related. I love the black and pink colors too. There was a review saying to order these half a size up. I was nervous about my order since I ordered it true to my normal size. I am glad I did, they are a perfect fit. Definitely order for your normal size.
I have worn this shoe brand for several years now. Great overall support. I normally wear a size 8 1/2 but with this brand I do have to go up a half size. Great fit and comfort right out of the box!
