Merrell Kids Skyjumper Dual Strap (Infant/Toddler)
These are very cute and give my son a very dressy look. He is 2 and has blocks for feet so these shoes are a great fit. Is true to size and good for kids with thick feet.
I bought these for my four year old son who has wide feet.  I was happy to finally find a pair of shoes that were wide enough for him! They are also super cute.  They do get points off for not having half sizes and the white cap at the front of the shoe got really dirty after just a half hour of play.  They are sneakers, I don't expect them to stay clean. They are good for kids with wide feet.
