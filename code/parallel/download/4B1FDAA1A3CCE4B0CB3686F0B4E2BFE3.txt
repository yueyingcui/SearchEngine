Nike LunarSpeed Lite+
Very disappointed with the size and fit of this shoe. I wear a 9.5 and this shoe actually fit my wife better than me (she wears a 9.0 in womens). Shoe is very narrow and is certainly lightweight. Have a hard time believing that even if the shoe fit, it would stand up to years of wear. Appears European sizing may be in part to blame here. If considering, perhaps try a full size up?
