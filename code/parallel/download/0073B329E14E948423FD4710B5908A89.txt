Ryka Endure XT 2
I wanted basically white comfortable shoes and these work well. I wear orthotics and there was adequate room to insert them under the insole. The price seemed reasonable for the quality. I ordered the Ryka Sport Walker Advance at the same time, in the same size but they were too short. I chose the "no arch support," but then I have high arches so that may not be applicable to others.
I've been wearing Rykas for years, so I know to order up a size. The 9 fits me perfectly, and I usually wear an 8 or 7.5 in a regular shoe. The toe box is roomy, and the heel is not too wide, as I have very narrow heels.

I am on my feet all day at work on concrete floors.  Have plantar fasciitis and inserts.  These are so far the most comfortable shoe. Not a cure of course. But gets me through the day without so much pain. My shoe size is 7 but with inserts I have to wear 8 1/2.
My first pair of Ryka's and the brand came highly recommended by other students in my dance exercise class. The support is good.  My arch is high so I still need an arch support insert. It is true to size.
