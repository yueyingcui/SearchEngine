The best pair of sneakers I have ever worn. Comfortable, stylish, and true to size. I have to admit I am spoiled. No other but these from now on.
My teenage son likes these shoes even though he wears a size 16 and I think they look like skis in this long size.  They have no arch support and I feel they are very cheaply made but he likes them and asked me to buy them for him. This is his second pair.  The first pair lasted quite a long time so they must be better made than they appear but they look like cheap shoes to me.  They have no support of any kind inside. 
These shoes are more comfortable and stylish than most of the low profile shoes i\'ve tried out. They felt true to size and width as well. I recommend this shoe for anyone looking for a Converse alternative with a little more arch support and style.
This is a great shoe. Although it seems something so thin and small wouldn't be comfortable, it is. They provide great comfort and are made of light weight material. I am often held back by big, heavy, bulky shoes (I am looking at you "O"), but these are great. They ran a bit big, so make sure to get your target size or smaller.
Love the shoe. Runs a 1/2 size small so order accordingly. This is my new favorite shoe. Love it.
