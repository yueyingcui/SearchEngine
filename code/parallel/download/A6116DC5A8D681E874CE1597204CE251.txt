Jessica Simpson Kids Cassie (Youth)
Super cute shoe but exhibits the dismay I have in finding shoes for my kids. A size one ballet flat she owns already is perfect "grow into" size, but this shoe is a size one - no sock and already on the order of too small. It drives a mother nuts.
These shoes are super cute! With shiny gold and gold sparkles mixed in with the cheetah. Beware, we ordered a size 2 and it's huge! My other daughter's size 11 [girls] is perfect. I think the larger sizes run giant. Super cute as a dress tennis shoe.
Such a cute little sneaker! Goes with almost everything without looking so blah. Seems true to size and she's happy to run like the wind in them!
These shoes are adorable! They are very girly, but still hold up for good kid play! I would say that they seem half a size small. Order up just a litle.
