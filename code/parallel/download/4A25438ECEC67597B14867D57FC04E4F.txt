PUMA Tekkies
Just right if this is what you want. They are practically weightless and cut slightly large, at least in size 12. I bought them to use as boat shoes and they work fine. They are comfortable, dry quickly, but offer zero support. 

Expect something about half the weight of the Keds they look like. 
Very basic shoe, almost nothing to them at all.  Cloth and a bit of rubber.  But, I ordered mine a size small and they still felt way too big.  They're going back, and I didn't like them enough to exchange for a smaller size.  
I thought these shoes were pretty stylish. I got the light grey ones.  Didn't expect them to have any cushion at all but to my surprise there is a cushiony sole in them. Not alot but enough mainly for the heel. I have flat feet so idk if that would be a factor or not. I give the shoes five stars for comfort because they are way more comfortable then what i would have expected from such a thin shoe. They are a great alternative for a classic look. I like the fact that the fabric is not stiff. They are true to size and fit me just as they should. I haven't had a problem with my heel popping out or the spine of the shoes coming off my foot. I would buy more pairs in different colors.
