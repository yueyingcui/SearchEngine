SKECHERS D'lites - Cover Girl
Super comfy. Lots of support. I feel that these are a great pair of shoes. However, they do run a tiny bit short. Not even a full half size small, but just a little on the short side.
These are cute and have some shiny sparkly bits that I liked (like the Sketchers logo) more in person than on the site.  But I had to return them because they do run small.  I'm normally a 9 or a 10 but the 10 in these is too snug... I bought them for hiking but don't think I'd be comfortable.  They're cushy and all that though, so if you get the right size I'm sure they'd be great to wear.
Lightweight.  They make my feet appear smaller which I love with long 9 1/2 size feet. On my feet all day as nurse and they are very comfortable and my feet are not tired at the end of my shift.
These are nice and comfortable shoes. I love the color and they are very neutral. As usual with Sketchers I usually have to go up half a size from normal.
