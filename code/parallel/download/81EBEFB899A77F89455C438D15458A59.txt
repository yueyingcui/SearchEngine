Nike Action Kids Oncore 2 Jr (Toddler/Youth)
My son loves the shoes! I ordered the wrong size to begin with and the customer service for the return was fantastic! They paid to ship the shoes back and the new pair to me, plus the new pair arrived the very next day! Outstanding customer service and couldn't find a better price anywhere else online.
It is not easily discernible in the pictures, but "ink" is very purple. The shoe is true to size, great style...but if purple scares you - avoid the aqua/ink color model. I was shocked when I opened the box. Luckily, my son liked the shoe (would not have been my choice).
