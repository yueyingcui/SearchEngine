Nike Kids Hustle D 5 (Toddler/Youth)
Great sneakers for young kids playing basketball. Look like the real deal. Have had trouble in the past finding 'authentic' basketball shoes for small feet - these are great! Fit true to size.
Very pleased - my son wanted Nike High tops - problem was I couldn't find his size anywhere. He got these and he was thrilled - so was I - great looking sneaker.
Great shoes. Good quality. They fit true to size, and look so snazzy on my 7 year old!
