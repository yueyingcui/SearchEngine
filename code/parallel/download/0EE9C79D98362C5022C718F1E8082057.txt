Kalso Earth Glide - Vegan
Thanks everyone for your reviews. The toe box fits over my painful arthritic toes and makes me pain free as soon as I put the shoes on. I can hardly believe it. They are true to size. I have sciatica now and it even relieves that pain. They are simply terrific.
I cannot live without my Earth shoes! They run true to size and the comfort is great. I recommend them highly, you will not be disappointed.
This shoe fits and feels wonderful! I love them! I also love that they are vegan! I wear a size 7 and the 7 in this shoe fit perfect... You will love it!
I'd never ordered shoes online before this.  I always try on several pair in stores, different sizes and styles, and often leave with nothing in hand.  I'm delighted to say that these shoes are everything I'd hoped for.  They're comfortable as can be and fit just right.  I'll be ordering more in the future.
If you have had foot surgery, especially for a torn tendon, get these shoes. I've tried about 6 different types of athletic shoes now and these are the only ones I have not sent back. They are so light and comfortable. The only negative thing I can say is that due to less structure/leather, the heel does not stand up - it shrugs down, but this does not make it uncomfortable in any way. I only wish they made this in a style with more leather for use in wet weather. I'm going to order another color, so I have two pair. I normally wear a full size larger in an athletic shoe, but not with this shoe. My regular shoe size is perfect, even with socks. I love this shoe!
OMG! What wonderful shoes! I followed the advice of others and ordered 1/2 size larger - perfect fit. I have never had a lighter weight tennis shoe which is fabulous for the 50 lb. luggage weight limit.
