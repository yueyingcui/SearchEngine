Stride Rite SRT Landon (Infant/Toddler)
Great shoe - exactly what you would expect from Stride Rite. Size is an issue. Foot measured 5 3/8" inch. Size chart said size 7. I ordered size 8, to give 3/8" wiggle room, but it is huge - almost 7/8" extra room. Next time I will not order a size up at all, assuming they have already built in wiggle room into the size chart.
These are the only shoes that I will buy for my son. He has wide feet and these are the only shoes that fit him comfortably. And they look adorable too. I have them in blue and brown. And I plan on getting the same pair when he needs a bigger size.
Look and size are good. The problem is we have only had the for about a month and the material on the straps has already started to severely unravel. We expect better build quality for this price range. Other Stride Rites that we have purchased in the past have held up well. Not these. I would not recommend that you buy these.
Great shoes. The leather makes them instantly broken in and while I normally go for laces for a good fit, the two straps work very well to get a good fit. I like that the front is not pointed and gives plenty of room for toes, without being too wide. The removable insoles with size guide gives you confidence when buying shoes online without a shoe store fitting.
Great shoes, the shipping is super fast and price is really good, website is easy and they have the size you are looking for. The shoes are true to size and easy for the 2 year old to take on and off. This a shoe you can hand down and holds up well.
