Orthaheel Dr. Weil by Orthaheel Rhythm Walker
These are great shoes, that are very comfortable, and I love the color. They are on the small side. I usually wear 6Â½/7 due to high instep and medium-wide feet. I ordered size 8 and they fit very well. The only adjustment I had to do was to not lace the very top holes to accomodate my high instep. My single complaint is that the laces do nit stayed tied without a double knot.
I had ordered my regular size, 7 1/2, it was entirely too tight, then I ordered an size 8, it is also too small and tight.
I ordered these in my usual size.  I wear a half size smaller in the orthaheel Mary Jane.  These were too small in my usual size but I cannot order a half size larger because my size is 10.5 and they don't make it in this size for some reason.  If it runs this small they should make it in larger sizes.   I wrote Dr. Weil on his site two times about this, because the shoe itself is comfortable just tight.  I received no answer to the email.  I had to send these back.
Nice looking shoes, not as bulky as the walker. Unlike other Ultraheel shoes, these can be ordered in 1/2 sizes. I ordered my normal size, but they were very tight both in length and width. They didn't have as much arch support as the walkers, so I didn't order a size bigger. The arch support in these is equal to the Mary Janes, which isn't enough for my plantar fasciitis.
This shoe was a half size smaller than the Orthheel sandals. There was no way to add a pair of sock, even thin ones.
