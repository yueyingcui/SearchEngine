Merrell Chameleon 4 Ventilator GORE-TEXÂ®
I had a pair of these boots for about 6 years, then recently when looking for new ones, I tried on just about every other pair in the store before settling on these again. Great shoes. Well built, keep my feet comfortable (if a little warm) I wore these on rough terrain in Africa, and while hiking around the Northwest. Issues, I typically wear a size 13. Need these in a 14. They breathe OK, but I tend to get a little warm in them.
Excellent shoe true size. Your feet will feel secured in these Merrell in any terrain.
These shoes are fantastically comfy and have great cushioning and support.  My wife and I walk 3.2 miles every day on hard surface streets and these shoes make it a pleasure.  I have had Merrell Chameleons before and this version is better.  My prior Chameleons wore out in less than a year.  Hope to get more mileage out of this pair given the high cost.  My actual shoe size measured with one of those foot tools is 9 wide.  These shoes are 9.5 medium and fit perfect.
