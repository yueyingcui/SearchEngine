Speedo Womens Beach Runner
I know people said these run large (so I ordered two sizes) the 10 fits me perfectly.
Loved these shoes. They do run a full size (maybe 1 1/2 sizes) large. Luckily I read the reviews prior to ordering. I ordered a size smaller - fit great. The are comfy and cute!
I bought these for the lake and river and I really like them. They fit true to size. They are comfortable and lightweight. They are also cute on!
I wanted some water shoes for the beach and water. I did as the others had suggested and got a full size smaller and they fit great. I've no been the water yet but so far they are comfortable, light with a soft sole, so you can feel the ground.
Well, I ordered these shoes for a trip to Holiday World on Friday, and I ordered my regular size, a size 6, but they are huge! So I got online and ordered a 5 in hopes that I'll get them in time but because of July 4th I don't think I will. Other than them running a full size bigger, they are perfect! Super comfy and the adjustable strap is great for my narrow feet! Cross your fingers I get the 5 in time!
I bought these shoes to use at a lake and river. They are very cute and look like they will be perfect. However, they are at least a size too big. I ordered an 8 (my usual size) but they are at least a 1/2 to a whole size too big. I'll try the 7 as there are no 1/2 sizes.
