Nike Zoom Streak 4
This shoe is on a curved last which may not work for some feet which need a straighter and roomier base. The shoe has a glued in liner which can be removed but in trying to use an orthotic under the liner the shoe is too tight across the midfoot most probably because of the curved last. The shoe runs at least one half size small. The heel feels quite soft, perhaps too soft. The shoe uses a very airy mesh which will be cooler for summer running.
