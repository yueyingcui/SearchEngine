Vans Mohikan W
These fit to your feet. They are probably among the best shoes that I have ever owned. The only thing I would watch out for is that if you normally wear a certain Vans size, go up half a size when dealing with women's sizes. But that just depends on whether your feet are wide or narrow. Mine are very narrow so my normal Vans size, 7Â½, fit very well.
