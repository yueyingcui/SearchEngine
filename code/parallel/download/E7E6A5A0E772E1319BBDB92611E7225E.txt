Keen Kids Ambler (Toddler/Youth)
So far so good! These are nice looking shoes and the fit seems true to size. I got a blister on my toe on the first day, but they were broken in by the end of the first week. Many expensive shoes have fallen apart quickly with my active seven year old, but so far all of our Keens have held up well enough to be passed down to younger sibling. As long as they keep up this quality, I will keep buying Keens!
This is the second pair of this style of Keen shoes I've purchased for my son (now 4). Although more pricey than other options, they are completely worth it! He can easily put these on by himself (he could at 3 as well). They are durable! They withstand the abuse of a boy's adventures! He wore the first pair almost daily for 9 months and they still look great. And just FYI, I purchased both pair a size bigger than his current size so that he could wear them longer. It worked -- they stayed on and was thrilled -- and he's still wearing the first pair almost a year later.
My 4 year old son loves these shoes. They are great quality and will be great for all type of adventures this spring and summer. I thought they ran pretty true to size. My son is a size 13 and they fit just right I was expecting them to be a bit larger.
I had to return to buy a size larger and a bit too big . . . just hoping they'll grow into them this winter. I wish these came in half sizes and would prefer another color for girls!
