Nike Zoom Waffle XC 9
I bought these for my son. He loves them, says that they fit perfectly and are very comfortable. He ran the 100m, 200m, and pole-vaulted, and they suited those events very well for a first year track member. Knowing that spikes usually fit slimmer than running shoes, I did buy him a half-size bigger, but he is right on that border of fit, anyway.
These shoes are way too narrow, making them feel smaller than usual. The size is good but the narrowness is ridiculous. There is no way someone with a 9.5 shoe size has feet this narrow. I can't afford to return my shoes because I have a race this Saturday and these are all I got. I guess I'll just have to go with it.
