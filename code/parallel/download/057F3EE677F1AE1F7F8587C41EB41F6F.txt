PUMA PG Tallula Women
Good looking shoe. I wish it had a little more arch support. After 18 holes (not walking but in a cart) my feet were sore. As most golf shoes I have tried, this shoe also ran on the small side and I had to order a 1/2 size larger than my normal size. The first pair I received did not have the spike replacement tool included in the box. I only realized I was missing it was I received the larger second pair.
