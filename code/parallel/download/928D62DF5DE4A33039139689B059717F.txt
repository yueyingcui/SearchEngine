Nike Free TR2 Winter
Wow...another incredible Nike Free. Based on other reviews, ordered 1/2 size larger, and this was a perfect fit. This one is designed to be warmer, and imagine it will be. Extremely comfortable, and good for anything - running, court, elliptical machines.
Very comfortable shoe. It's light and flexible one of the best Nikes I've ever owned. It ran a bit small though. Had to go up half a size. Got lots of compliments also!
