Vasque Velocity GTX
I use Superfeet (green) inserts which makes these a comfortable fit with solid support. Half-size up from normal. Great fit out-of-the box. Performs well on the trail and street... It is a hiking shoe so it is more stiff than a running shoe.

Nice shoe. Tested them when I first got them by standing in a 2 to 3 inch tub of water to see if they remained waterproof; nice and dry. Pretty comfortable for a boot. I'm somewhat flat-footed, so the arch support felt fair. Not a lot of cushion, but I have to remember it's a boot and not a tennis shoe. I think it could use a "Superfeet" insert though, but that's just me. It has a nice sized toe-box and the shoes lace up very easily with just one, smooth pull. Overall, I'd recommend them.
These are without a doubt the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. Perfect true to size fit. Gore-tex waterproofing works great. I think I'll get an extra pair to put away in case they discontinue the model!
