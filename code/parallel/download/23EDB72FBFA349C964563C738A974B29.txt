The North Face Women's Havoc
I have very "bad" feet -- chronic pain in both feet -- and need shoes that have a lot of support. I usually have wear hiking shoes. The Havocs are a little cuter than the usual hiking shoe but are still pretty supportive. They feel a little big/long but I thought if I traded them for 1/2 a size down it might be too small, so I stuck with a bit big. My feet are also fairly narrow, and these fit well in the width. They're quite comfortable for doing errands, etc.
