Newton Running Women's Motion
I found this shoe ran 1/2 size small on one foot and a full size small on the other! I'm disappointed because I'd love to try running in these. The mid-foot cushioning makes it feel like I imagine walking with normal instead of flat arches might feel. Another disappointing feature was the construction. The finish edge of the tongue was rough and itchy on my foot. For this price, I expect better. That said, I ordered 2 pairs and only found this problem on one shoe.
