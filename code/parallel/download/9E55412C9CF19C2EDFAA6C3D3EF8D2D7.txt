adidas Opticourt 8.5 
My daughter paid for a pair of these at her school for the volleyball team. She normally wears an 8-1/2 but ordered an 8 in these. They are still too big! She should have ordered a whole size smaller than her normal size. Now she is stuck with the shoes. Why can't Adidas get the sizing more accurate? I don't recommend buying unless you can try on in a shoe store first.
