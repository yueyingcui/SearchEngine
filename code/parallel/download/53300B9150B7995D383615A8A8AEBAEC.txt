PUMA H-Street+
Very cute and comfy, but was a half size larger. I am usually a true 8, which is what I ordered but they were too large and I had to return them. Once they get the color I want in I am going to buy them again. 
I purchased these shoes for a two week trip to Italy and Germany where I knew I'd be doing a lot of walking. They were perfect! My feet stayed comfortable the entire trip! I like how the shoes are not bulky like typical athletic shoes. They are also incredibly lightweight. It almost feels like you're just wearing socks! (I did have to order a half size larger than my usual shoe size.)
These shoes are super light and soft, but don't offer a ton of support. They are great, but maybe not for an entire day or weekend of walking. As with all Pumas, I went up a 1/2 size when ordering - they are definitely narrow.
I'm a power tumbling coach and these have been my number one tumbling show for years. My wife wears them to tumble as well. They fit true to size, fits snug to the foot.  
A very light and comfy shoe. Not recommended on dusty terrain, which is where I'm using them, however. The mesh, which is great on a hot summer day for ventilation, will also make for some dirty feet. But these are generally great for running. And true to size.
Wonderful summer shoe and extremely lightweight. These would be great for travel. They run a bit small, however. I had to size up a half-size.
