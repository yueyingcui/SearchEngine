Keds Champion-Leather CVO
The shoe is comfortable and true to size. I purchased the leather type knowing I would be going to events in the country where there would be a lot of dirt areas. When I got home I wiped the dirt off and the shoes were like new. I would recommend them for a casual comfy runaround shoe.
If you want the comfort of a sneaker, but not for sports, these sneakers look nice with black tights and a neat day-time outfit.  I buy one size wider so that I can fit into the shoes a 3/4 heel/arch insert and a Dr Scholl's liner.  They're comfortable all day long and look neat as a pin.
I have been wearing Keds as long as I can remember, and I am 53. My mom wore them while I was growing up. Both of us still love them. The white fabric originals are staples in our wardrobes, and it's nice to have the leather version, too. I have found that the "fancier styles" do not run true to size, but these do. Although they do not have enough support for exercising or hiking, they are perfect for just running around. Try them, you will become a fan!
I looked at some of the other reviews and they said the shoe ran narrow. I ordered an 11W. I got them super-fast! But alas, they were too big. I'm exchanging them for a 10W, so they are pretty comfy and pretty true to size. And the customer service guy (Jim) was extremely nice, and he shipped the new order 1-day priority! Yes!
