The North Face Men's Ultra 106 GTX XCRÂ®
This shoe has great support, a very sturdy sole, and comfort and cushion in the heel. I would say they run a bit on the small size, so try a 1/2 size larger.
Great shoe with very comfortable fit for hiking and trail runs. A little on the heavier side, but North Face shoes always fit the same in regards to size and they can take a beating.
Nice support. I use them mainly for day hiking on prepared trails. Runs true to size.

Great shoe, true to size, and the best shoe I have seen in a long time. 

The shoe runs a little smaller than I expected but once I found the right size I was thrilled. I wear these shoes daily to work and clean them up to go out. Would recommend.
