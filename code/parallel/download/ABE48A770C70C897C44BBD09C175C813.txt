New Balance WO900 Hi
Not very comfortable, tight in the toes, feels smaller than stated size, rubs on ankles.
I have been an exclusive wearer of New Balance athletic footwear ever since I bought my first pair roughly 35 years ago at their authentic factory store in Brighton, MA. They are exceptionally well made, and I've never had a problem in all this time. They fit me perfectly, are consistently sized, and comfortably accommodate my orthotics. The foot part of these boots fits like all my other NBs, and I did take care to break them in before taking them on a hiking trip.
