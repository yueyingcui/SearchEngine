PUMA H-Street+ NM Wn's
These are very nice shoes! They are a little flimsy, but I like minimalist sneakers. I am between a size 8 and 8Â½, but the 8 fits perfectly!
These sneakers are great. They are so comfortable. I have "problem feet" so I am always in a lot of pain. However, these shoes help ease the pain. They are so soft but supportive. They are also better looking in person. I purchased both the white and aqua colors and I love them both. In addition, they are true to size. These shoes are great for everyone! Even those of us suffering with foot problems.
Exactly what I was looking for. Extremely lightweight and flexible enough to move quickly. Great for playing table tennis. Sizes run about 1/2 size small.
Love these sneakers! They are incredibly light weight and by far the most comfortable sneaker I've ever had! Just bought two more pair! True to size and width. Highly recommend you purchase these!
