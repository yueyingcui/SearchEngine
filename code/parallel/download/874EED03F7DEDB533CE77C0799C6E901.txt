Nike Action Kids Mogan Mid 2 Jr (Toddler/Youth)
Runs true to size with a little on the wider side. Very comfortable and the green color is very nice and bright.
My 11 year old loves these shoes. He is super athletic and gives them a good work out and they are holding up great. The size was true.
My flip flop addict boys are very picky about tennis shoes on their feet. These shoes are very stylish, high quality durability, and I never get any complaints about them being uncomfortable. It's a miracle! Remember that Nike always runs small, so order the next size up.
