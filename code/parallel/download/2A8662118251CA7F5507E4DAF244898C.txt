If you're considering this pair, get it. I put in the order and they came about 7 or 8 days later in perfect condition. They're extremely comfortable and even give some protection from the snow, they are mids after all. (I got them in the winter). I got a size 10, which tends to run a little big when it comes to skate shoes. Also, they come with extra lacing of a different color, so you can change up the look, if you want. You do have to lace them yourself, but that was cool with me because I change the lacing style quite often myself. One thing I didn't like was there's a little E symbol on the bottom that will actually peel off relatively quickly. I'd say within the first month or two. It's not really not noticeable though. All in all I'd have to say they're a great pair. A good combination for both for fashion and durability.
