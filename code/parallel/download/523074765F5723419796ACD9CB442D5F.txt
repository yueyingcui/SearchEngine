Nike Action Braata LR
Nice looking shoes.  Little arch support.  Felt a half size larger due to the thinness of the suede.  Don't think they will last very long.  Definitely not a "skate shoe." Might return them or just use them for nice shoes for my 13 year old son. Definitely not every day shoes due to the materials/construction and lack of support.
