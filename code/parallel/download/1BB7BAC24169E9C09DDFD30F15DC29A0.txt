Vans Kids Big School Core (Infant/Toddler)
My son has had several pairs of Vans and has loved them. I ordered the black/white checked Vans because they are so hip and come with the velcro closure. Unfortunately, I noticed right away that they were not made as well as our other pairs. Right off I could see that the velcro straps were unevenly sized and poorly constructed, as was the "tongue" -- it was not sewed in unevenly. Also, the logo on the back of the shoe was glued on crooked. We still kept them, and my son was wearing them. But after having them for less than two weeks, the innersoles pulled out of both shoes! So sadly, I have decided to return them. I am so disappointed. It looks to me like this shoe was made in a different factory than the other Vans we have purchased for our son (maybe even a different country?).
These are our 2nd pair of these Vans. They've actually improved the design -- the straps are more sturdily constructed, making it easier for my son to put them on himself. (He's almost 4.) We were purchasing the Converse shoes just like this but I think I like these better. Sturdier straps and better toe for a kid who rides a run bike and is constantly dragging his feet to brake. They do seem to run a little large but the half sizes compensate for that nicely.
Very cute and very true to size. Nice to have something between a 5-6 for my 18 month old. It's been a struggle to find good shoes for him to play in that aren't too big or too small. He never tried to take these off which is a great sign that they are comfortable to play in!

Great shoes, my little guy loves them. Vans do run big, so be careful of wanting to order the shoe big so that they will grow into them! My boy is a size 9 and I ordered him a 9 and there is plenty of room.

These are great shoes. My son love to wear them, and they are very easy to put on. They do run a size big. The style is great too.
