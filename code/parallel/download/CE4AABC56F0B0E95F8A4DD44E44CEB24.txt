Teva Sky Lake
Just got this shoe and it is immediately comfortable out of the box. It has support for my narrow foot and I get a natural rolling motion when I step from heel to toe with super stability. I usually order up a half size, but in this shoe, I ordered the actual size I wear, 6.5, and I think it will fit even with a heavier sock.
I have these on as I type. I've had them for about 6 weeks and I love them...true to size and great for walking.
