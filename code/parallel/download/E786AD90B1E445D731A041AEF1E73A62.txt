adidas Originals Kids Superstar 2 Core (Infant/Toddler)
Love these! I started buying them for my daughter when she was one and half and have bought 2 different sizes up since (she's 3 now). These are my shoe of choice for her if I know we're going to be doing a lot of walking. She has never complained about these shoes which is a big deal for us. I also love that with them being all white they look cute with so many outfits.
Runs true to size. I love this sneaker! I put them on my daughter with jeans, shorts or skirts looks great with everything.
Totally cute and well-made. It's nice that Adidas adds a removable insert you can use to check the shoe's size on your kid's foot. Brilliant. Every child shoe should have that! Side note: the printable kid shoe size chart sizes generously. If you use it, the shoes will fit and have plenty of room to grow.
Super cute! My little man looks great in these! These shoes run true to size.
Love these shoes. My son is between a 5 and a 6, so I went with the 6. They fit, but give him a little room to grow. I would say they are true to size.
These are so cute on my son's feet. There is a big difference in the size 4s and the 5s (too big). Overall good shoe.
Shoe is too cute, but there is a huge difference between size 4 and size 5. I ordered both, and ended up with the size 4 to size 5 was just too big.
I read all the reviews so I ordered my son's shoes a half size bigger (they are too big!). I think they are very true to size. Also I wouldn't use the size chart on the page, they are bigger than that says. Besides that, I think they are adorable shoes and I love them!
