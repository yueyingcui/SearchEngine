Nike Air Max Run Lite 3
I normally wear a size 11 tennis shoe, but had to go with 11.5 with this tennis shoe. (Nike's run small) also, if you like low cut socks beware! These shoes eat your socks! I agree with a previous reviewer -- the toe support is really different, feels like there is nothing there (good or bad).
