Propet Wash & Wear Slip-on
The shoe looks great. I have worn them a number of times and like how they look with jeans. If I order them again, I will check to see if they have an extra wide size. I find the wide to be too tight with a heavier sock on. I wish I had found that out before I wore them outside. Maybe because of the tightness, I find my foot aches after a few hours of wearing. I tried a gel pad, but that only makes the shoe tighter on my foot.
I bought the Propet Wash and Wear Slip On's for my grandfather and he loves them! They felt true to width and size. We highly recommend these for anyone with wide feet.
Propet's wash & wear slip-on - 
When I first tried the shoes on they felt tight. I thought they would loosen up after wearing them for awhile. This did not happen. They still feel tight and uncomfortable. I would definitely order a 1/2 size bigger than normal.

These shoes are great. My husband loves them because they are comfortable and easy to put on. He had a pair before but they wore out after 3 years. I was lucky to find his size again.

My son loves these shoes!
My teenage son wears a wide size 15 shoe, and needed black sneakers for work in a fast-food restaurant. These shoes are beyond perfect! They slip on, are incredibly comfortable, and can be washed! Beat that!

After my long search - 
Six years ago I wore AND 1 post game shoes, which were similar to these. My wife worked for the company, so I was able to have quite a few pair. AND 1 no longer makes the shoe, and I have searched for a shoe that compared. I have finally found it. This shoe is so comfortable and looks good also. Since my purchase, I have been asked several times where I got the shoes. 
I will buy them in other colors, as soon as they become available in my size. I took the last size 11 in all 3 colors. 
Excellent shoes - 
I buy nothing but Propet. I have a large foot size and am hard to fit. Propet shoes are true to fit, comfortable, and last forever.
