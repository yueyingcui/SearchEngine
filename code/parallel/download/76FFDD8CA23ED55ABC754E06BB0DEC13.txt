Saucony Kids Baby Blaze A/C (Infant/Toddler)
I ordered two pairs for my twins, different sizes. They sent one right and the other one not. I called customer service and they rectified issue right then and I received correct size next day! Super to deal with and I love the shoes!
Bought shoe for twin toddlers and they love them. Lightweight, breathable, flexible. Fits true to size and is available in wide. Just wished they offered more color choices. These did not have the best style but function and comfort wise is top.
