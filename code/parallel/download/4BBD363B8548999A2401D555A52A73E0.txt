Nike Air Max Excellerate+
Love this shoe! Yeah bright...punch...but very nice and trendy and very light and comfortable for the gym! Wish they were cheaper...I'd get another pair! Tried the Nike Tailwind 4. And those are nice...but run small in the toe area. So these are true to size and I'm a size 10.
