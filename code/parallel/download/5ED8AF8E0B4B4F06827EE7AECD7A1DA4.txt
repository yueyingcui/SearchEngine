Converse Sea Star LS
I ordered these shoes for my fiance and his groomsmen to wear at our wedding since we were having a causal theme. The shoes arrived quickly and looked amazing! I wish they had fit amazing. When you hold them up to a regular Converse shoe of the same size, you can literally see the difference. They are quite narrow and a whole size smaller than the regular Converse shoes. Now normally, that would not be a problem and I would just buy the next size up for the boys, except my fiance is a size 13 normally and would need a 14 with these, but they stop at size 13. I unfortunately had to send these back. I am so sad because they really are a wonderful looking shoe. Go up a size when ordering if you can and you will be fine.
