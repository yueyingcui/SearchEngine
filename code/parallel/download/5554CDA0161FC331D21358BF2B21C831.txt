SKECHERS Danza
I tried many "dance" shoes and these were the most comfortable and looked the best. I replaced the inner sole with an orthotic for good support. I took a half size larger than my normal size.
These shoes were perfect in every way. Price, fit, delivery.  I just put them on and danced...no break in needed and they were true to the size I wear.
Ordered an 8 and 8.5, I have a wide foot with a med arch so I tend to go between those two sizes. But in this case neither fit. The shoe felt too narrow, couldn't even try them in Zumba class. I wanted these to work so cute for Zumba, but no go.
These shoes are so comfortable. I use them for zumba, I got them half a size bigger. I am normally a 7, 7Â½ fits just fine. They are wide enough, too. I love these dance sneakers!
