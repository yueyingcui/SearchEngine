Stride Rite Kayla H&L (Infant/Toddler)
My 18 month old daughter was blessed with some extremely fat feet! I have a hard time finding shoes that fit her properly, and most of the time she ends up not wearing any at all. I stumbled across these shoes and they ended up being perfect. They are wide enough for her feet, easy to get on, and the velcro is an added bonus because it makes the job even more pleasant. I actually purchased these in size 5 and six, and until the day that her feet stop growing width wise- I will keep buying them!
