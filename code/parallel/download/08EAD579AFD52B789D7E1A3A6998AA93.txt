Vivobarefoot Evo M
Order at least a size more. I ordered 48 which typically plenty of room. But not even close.
I usually wear a 10 1/2 American but I got a 43 European size and it fit perfect.  I was skeptical about the no arch support at first, but then realized that barefoot running utilizes this principle to force you to run with a midstrike of the foot.  After starting off slow and getting through the initial soreness of calve muscles, this shoe will soon become the only thing you will want to run with.  It's stylish, light, and extremely comfortable after about two weeks.  I already own two pairs and plan on buying more.
The most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. No, seriously! Offers a true barefoot experience without attracting attention to your feet. I measured size 10, but with these shoes I had to get a full size smaller. There's still a good half inch of space around my toes in a size 9. There's a couple flaws though. The upper folds and pinches against your upper toes. This can be annoying for something wearing these without socks. Second, the yellow V on the upper peeled off within two days. It's very thin sticker kinda of like a temporary tattoo. This kind of flaw is not acceptable for a this priced shoe. I returned them and getting Neo's instead.
