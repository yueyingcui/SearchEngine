Nike Air Flex Trainer II
Got these for my boyfriend. He uses them to run and walk in and he said they are so comfortable. I will be buying the same one's for my 20 year old brother. They are true to size and cushioned just right for their feet.
These shoes are stylish, light, very comfortable and have a tad bit wider toe box that accommodates my tailor's bunion. The only other Nike trainers that had this wider toe box was the old Nike SC Trainer which has been discontinued. I found these ran half a size small, so I returned them and ordered half a size larger.
