Teva Freewheel
Love this shoe! Bought the first pair and wore them 4 out of the first 5 days of owning them and then bought the second pair. They are so comfortable and just ugly enough to be cute! My usual size was fine even with overpronation orthotics.
Cute shoe but feels half a size smaller. It seems to be really comfortable on the soles of your feet but since my toes were hitting the front of the shoe (I wear an 11 and there is no larger size) I have to return them. I wish they could have fit.
