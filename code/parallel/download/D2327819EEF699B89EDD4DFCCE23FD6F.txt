Keen Zion
Just like some other people said, the toe box on these Keens is slightly smaller. They feel about a 1/2 size smaller than my other Keens but only up in the toe box width and length. Otherwise very comfortable. They are lighter weight than the other hiker style Keens.
Got these for a hiking holiday conquering the mountains (hills) of Acadia National Park. They performed as Keens should. Held on to even the most slick stream beds and moss covered stones. They are very light even for my size 12s. 
Uniform sizing continues to be a problem for Keen, at least in my case. This well-made pair of Keen Zions is no exception. I tried on a pair of size 10, the size of all three pairs of my Austins, and the Zions were way too short and too tight. I bought a pair of 10.5 which were okay initially. Now I am swimming in them, even with some inner sole build-ups. The shoes are good quality, but I continue to be baffled by the lack of uniformity in sizing among the models.

Just went to men's sizes for my 11 year old, this shoe fits well.  His foot is a slim, wide and Keens are one of the only shoes that he has been able to wear. This shoe is also stylish enough for a picky kid.
