Shimano SH-MT53
First time clipless pedal user and found these shoes to be a bargain. I really like the higher boot cut for added ankle protection on the trails. I was able to install the cleats with no problems at all and was riding with my new pedals and shoes without any issues. Did some heavy trail riding and the shoes felt really good. The cleats are recessed into the the bottoms so no issues (feel or noise) while walking on concrete. Several veteran cyclists commented on their appearance so I know they must look good. The sizing was true, I am about a US size 10 and the 44's fit perfectly. I would recommend these to anyone.
