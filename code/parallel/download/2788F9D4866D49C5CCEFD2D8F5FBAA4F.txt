Tsukihoshi Kids Youth Speed (Youth)
Great kid shoes! My 5 year old has wide feet and these are perfect! They do run large...no doubt order 1/2 size down. They are very well made and easy for him to put on and off himself. Love them! He gets complimented all the time on the bright blue and orange too!
