PUMA Esito Vulc Sala
Nice light shoe. I usually use wide width but this one was great. Got 1/2 size larger than regular. Would make a great driving shoe...would not wear if I did a lot of walking but around the house or sitting at work and just walking around office it's great.
Bought these as a gift for my nephew and he loved them. So I assume they were true to size.
This is very stylish and very comfortable shoes! Love the color selection and details in these. They fit true to my size 9 1/2. I was very pleased with this purchase! One of my favorite Puma shoes!
