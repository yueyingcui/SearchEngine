Habitat Quest
Look cool, seem well constructed. About half size too small. Is a simple, sort of old school feel to them which for me means that it doesn't have the cushy insole. Instead they are a bit harder but are good if you are looking to have more feel. The red color is a bit brighter than pictured. Because the size was too small I am returning them and trying something different; had they fit I probably would have kept them.
These shoes are very stylish. I have received many positive comments on their look, but beware; these shoes are not meant for walking around steep areas. I live in a place where there are lots of hills and the first days I wore the shoes were painful until I broke them in. These shoes are made for skating, they have extra cushy insole. They run true to size, but the colors are a bit lighter than the ones displayed online. Cool shoes!
