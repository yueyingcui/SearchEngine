Nike Free TR2
I bought Nike Free TR2 using the same size I've been wearing. They are designed to not wear socks so I have to buy thin socks. They are perfect for resistance training and the Arc and cross trainer machines. Takes some getting use to with the treadmill since they lack cushioning for walking and running but I believe my feet will be stronger as time goes on.
Fast, efficient and the size was perfect. My son loves his new shoes.
I use these sneakers for training and casual. They are very comfortable and allow my feet to breathe (however, they're not true to size so buy half a size larger).

Good shoes for exercising. About one size small. I wear 9 and a half usually. The 10 is about a half size small.
Overall satisfied.
The shoes looks great, but I just found them way too small. I wear size 14s, whether they be dress shoes, trainers, sandals, so when I ordered these in size 14, I never thought they would not fit. It turns out I could barely get my feet in them and immediately returned them. I am still giving the shoe high marks because I like the look and I have had no problems with Nikes once they fit, but the sizing here was way off.
