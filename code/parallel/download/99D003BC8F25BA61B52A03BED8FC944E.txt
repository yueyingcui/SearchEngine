New Balance Kids KT561 (Toddler/Youth)
My daughter has a wide foot with a high, thick instep. Needless to say, her feet are extremely tricky to fit and very often, the shoes that do fit are lacking in visual appeal. These are great! She loves the aesthetic: the teal is currently her favorite color and grey is all the rage right now, especially with bright contrasting colors. The shoes are very comfortable with plenty of width. Supportive but not stiff...just perfect for gym, track and kicking around. Experience has shown me that when we find a shoe she loves and that fits her feet, it's best to just go ahead and buy an extra pair in her current size and buy the next couple of sizes up...as we otherwise run into some lean shoe times unable to find things that fit. In terms of fit, I'd say that they fit true to size in every way.
