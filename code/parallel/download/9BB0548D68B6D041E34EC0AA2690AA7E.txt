Nike Zoom Breathe 2K11
These shoes are awesome! I get so many compliments on them. Great for hard or clay. Very comfortable and reminds me why I stick with Nike for all things tennis!  True size 8 for me. 
Problem with this pair is that the front of the shoe is tight on the top of the foot. Width is fine. Going a size up does not resolve the problem as the shooe then is just too big. 
I loved this shoe.  It fits true to size. I wear a 6 normally and I bought a 6.  I am very happy with this shoe.  It is both comfortable and stylish. 
I bought the Zoom Vomeros and loved them - nice size forefoot and narrow heel. In contrast, these shoes are too narrow and I don't have wide feet. What a disappointment.
