Montrail Mountain Masochist II Outdry
Love these! I tend to order hiking boots and running shoes a half size up so did with these and they fit perfectly. They are unbelievably comfortable. The tread on the bottom is comparable to a hiking boot, but these shoes are much lighter than your average hiking boot. I will be taking these to Afghanistan for my new job and think they will do very well in any rough terrain I encounter.
