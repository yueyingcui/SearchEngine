Vans Kids 106 Vulcanized (Toddler/Youth)
My son is 10 years old and loves these! He has them in the blue and in the grey. They run 1/2 size larger. 
I bought these for my 8 year old, who wanted shoes he could "run around in" that were like his big brother's Vans Authentic Core Classics. I wanted to avoid his wee feet being in as "unstructured" a shoe as the 'Classics and he was tired of wearing his Adidas Sambas, which I love for the support they give growing feet. This shoe was a nice answer. Substantial, structured and supportive, without the padding that bums him out in skate shoes. It also wears well, fits fairly true to size and is better than most Vans in terms of overall quality.
My 11 year old, 6th grade middle-schooler loves these shoes - they're actually his second pair as he outgrew the last size. He loves the color combination as it's "different" than most Vans. He wears these with gel heel inserts that you can get at the drugstore since there's not much padding in the footbed - with the inserts, he walks everywhere with them.
