Scarpa Mystic GTXÂ®
Fantastic shoe. Right out of the box, I took it with me as my trail shoe to do some hikes on some of St. John's (USVI) rockiest trails and it performed well. It had super grip on slippery rocks, a stiffer than usual sole for a shoe of this kind to negotiate uneven terrain better, and a tread pattern that just plain works for both casual walking and aggressive trail work. I don't know why I waited this long to buy my first Scarpa trail shoe (my first was the mountaineering Scarpa Mont Blanc GTX), but I'll definitely buy another Scarpa trail shoe in the future. Make sure to size up by 1/2. So if you normally wear an 11, go with 11 1/2.
True to size. Very comfortable. Stable and easy to wear with light weight or thicker socks. I have wide flat feet and I wear these everywhere.

I wear a 10.5 - needed to up size to an 11. However, the toe box is so narrow that I am sending back the 11 and looking for a new shoe. Really nice shoe, very small toe box - looks narrow too. Fits more like a climbing shoe than a hiker.
