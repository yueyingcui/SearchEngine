New Balance Kids KT20 (Youth)
Because these are a "minimal" type shoe, they look nice with shorts and capris and with our without socks. If you plan to wear them without socks, just use caution. They did require some break-in time for us - my daughter complained that the shoe rubbed the back of her achilles and she had to wear higher socks or a band-aid for the first couple of weeks. At least on my daughter, the back comes up just a smidge too high. That's the only downside. Other than that, the shoe still looks great and is holding up nicely after a month of heavy wear. Sizing seemed to be true to size, we didn't have to size up or down.
