Five Ten Spire
If you're a chick that's not lucky enough to have incredibly narrow feet, this is your shoe! I tried just about every women’s shoe I could find in my size and they were all painfully narrow! I usually wear a 9.5-10 women's but the 9.5 men’s fits perfect... a little snug, but that's what breaking in is for. Plus, five tens have awesome grip!
Great Shoe, but it will STRETCH.
I agree with the other reviewer that the Spire is an excellent first climbing shoe purchase. It will do everything you ask of it as you're learning the basics of movement on rock and will perform well up to the 5.11 range. The Spire is a very comfortable shoe as well, a fact it owes to it unlined leather upper - as you log vertical mileage in the shoe it will soften and literally mold to your foot. Any unlined leather climbing shoe will stretch some both in length and girth and the Spire is no exception! I wear a 9.5/10.0 US street shoe and sized my Spires down to an 8.0. Perfect fit after a short - if uncomfortable - break in period.
