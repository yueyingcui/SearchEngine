Nike Kids Free Run 3 (Toddler/Youth)
These shoes are good looking and very lightweight. My son loves them! He has wide feet and these fit him, although I would not consider these shoes to be overly wide in the toebox. What is wide is the shoe opening, he has to velcro them shut tightly. Also, I think they run a little small. He is just outgrowing a size 1.5 Reebok, and size 2.5 Nike is not much bigger than his Reeboks. But overall a great shoe!
My 8 years old loves these shoes. He goes to a private school and the red shoe follows their dress-code guidelines. They do however, run really big/wide -- so if your son has a narrow foot, these may not work. I had to order a 1/2 size smaller. They are soft, lightweight, and look great on. No complaints from my active 2nd grader.
Great shoe for our little man. He loves them and they are very easy to get on and off for him. Seem to run true to size so buy to fit.
Super cute shoes! By far my 4 year old son's favorite shoes ever. They fit true to size and are super lightweight and flexible. He has skinny little feet and these work really well on him. The orange reminds me of construction zone barrels but I have to say, they look super cute and he gets lots of genuine comments on how great they look and others want the same shoes. Really great for kids who don't like shoes and they are like wearing a slipper as so lightweight and flexible. And I need to mention we had these shoes the next day after I order them...can't get better service than that!
These shoes were just what we needed! My son was in a triathlon and needed shoes that were easy to get on and comfortable. Extra bonus was the color - very easy to spot! Great shoes, wish they came in bigger sizes - we'd order more just to have them ready to grow into!
