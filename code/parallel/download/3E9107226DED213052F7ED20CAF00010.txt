Vans Era Laceless
I liked the color of the shoes and the fact that they are lace less. If you are between sizes I suggest you go up. They fit snug on me with a thin sock. When I received the shoes some of the paint was missing on some of the grommets, and I considered returning them. However, my children convinced me that I was being too picky.
These shoes are great on style but you need to get them a size down. I usually wear 9s in Vans but if you want to wear these without laces you will need to get them tighter. I ended having to buy laces and wear them like regular Vans
Ordered a 6.5 (womenâ€™s) and we were unpleasantly surprised to find that the sizing is way too big (at least one whole size). It is puzzling since we have purchased similarly styled Vans (laceless) before in the same size. I will have to return them which is frustrating.

Maybe it's me, but I feel like the top of the shoes comes down too far on the top of the foot. It doesn't look like it would in the photos, but maybe it's because they feel a half size small. I wear a seven in Vans normally (SK8 Hi, and chukka low), so I got a seven and they feel just a half size too small. If you want slip0ons, and they have to be Vans I would consider the classic slip-on. Just my 2cents.
Cute shoe. Fits true to size. It does rub your heels in the back but Vans makes a sock specifically for this shoe. I will buy more Vans.
Pretty comfy shoes, but found it necessary to use laces on the top two eyelets. You may want to drop a 1/2 size to keep it snug. I haven't found any issues that others are having with the heal. This is a stylish shoe to slip on and walk out the door.
