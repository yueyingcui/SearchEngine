Biom Natural Motion by ECCO Biom Trainer 1.2
I have really high hopes for this shoe. I wear a 10.5 in Brooks and Mizumo, but the 10-10.5 for the Biom Trainer 1.2 was really long. I'll be returning for a smaller size.  Construction seems solid.  I'll revise my review when I get the other size in.
I am a big fan of Ecco shoes and after reading the Ecco website online info decided to order these and was ready to bite it on the cost. Comfy to me = worth the money. What a disappointment. I own several Ecco's and seems they are now much narrower. I'm usually a 9.5 and even tried a 10 and as comfy as the fabric is they still were too narrow, my feet were hanging over the side of the sole! They are constructed with quality materials, super comfy other than narrow. Good support and cushion but would fall under minimalist shoe. Color black with gray...ugly! Both sizes returned.
I was so hopeful that these would be my new favorites. Unfortunately, they just were not anything special and for the price, I expect an, "ahhhhhh" factor. They have virtually no support. The beet color is neon fuchsia. The fit is true to size. Back they go.
I have tried many shoes! I'm a nurse and walk all day and these shoes are a lifesaver. For once my feet are not aching at the end of the day. All I can say is thank you. I love the comfort and the looks are ok... I wear a 7 to 7.5 and the size 38 fits perfect.I never write reviews, but this shoe is worth it and deserves a 10 star review for me! I know they are more expensive but they are worth every penny and might save me money because I have stopped shoe shopping!
Each shoe has a different purpose but they are all alike when it comes to fit, comfort and support.  I'm very happy with these shoes and am getting ready to buy my fourth pair of these.  These are true to size and hug your feet.
