adidas Kids Goletto III Sparkle Net (Toddler/Youth)
Super cute shoes. My 3 year old daughter, who would only wear these if they were pink, loves them. She normally wears a size 7 but I had to get her 2 sizes bigger in these shoes.
I bought these for my daughter to wear during Tball. They are true to size and very cute for the Tball Diva!
