adidas Outdoor Terrex Fast X GORE-TEXÂ®
I normally wear a size 9D, but had to order a size 8.5D to fit the length.  However, the width was very narrow, I could barely get my foot into the shoe.  I doubled check the box and shoe just to make sure it was width D, and it was, never had this width issue with any other shoe before.
