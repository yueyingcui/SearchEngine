ECCO Golf Street Premiere
Had to exchange for smaller size. Odd, because I am a size 45 in the Ecco Street and a 44 in the Ecco Street Premiere. Anyways, fits great and great looking and functioning golf shoe!
I've always had the classic looking golf shoes, but when I needed a new pair, I thought I would give these new style "comfort" shoes (Ecco, Ashworth, etc.) a good look. One of the first concerns people have are the grip on the bottom. I actually think I have more grip on these shoes than any other Footjoy, Nike, etc. I've owned in the past. Really, the only downside to these shoes is that the bottom sole isn't replaceable like the spikes on a classic shoe. So, I'm concerned that they may get worn out when I'm not walking in grass (parking lot, etc.). I guess another downside is that they aren't water proof (just water resistant), but I rarely play in wet conditions. Plus, the comfort of these shoes outweighs everything. - I ended up deciding on this style from Ecco, in the grey, because of Freddy Couples. Plus, I thought the grey would match more clothing color combos. I even stopped wearing socks when I play golf and it is awesome. Sure, my feet get a little sweaty during the round, but the shoe is very breathable, and no socks makes the whole experience that much better (especially since I'm such a feel player). To sum things up, these are great shoes, just be sure to get a half a size smaller. They run a little long. Also, all the street premiere's come with two sets of laces. This color combo comes with orange laces and grey laces. I wear the grey laces so they aren't as flashy.
The cushion in the sole isn't as good as I expected.  It feels very firm.  However, I did walk nine holes in them, and they seemed fine.  I found that they ran rather large in size.  I had to go down a size and half, otherwise my feet felt like they were sliding inside the shoes during my swing.
