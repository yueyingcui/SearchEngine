adidas Originals Kids AR 2.0 (Toddler/Youth)
no contest.  this design is the winner in the five pair line-up of new for kindergarten shoes we tried.   my son loves blue.  he loves that these are very bright blue.  and that they are shiny.  i tend to go or more natural fabrics and  flexible styles but im into these.  they are not stiff as they look.  the sole is quite flexible. and i love the  bright pinkish orange accents.    we are happy!  -- but we may need to order a size up.  other shoes we ordered the same size look way bigger.  there isnt much arch support but a little!
