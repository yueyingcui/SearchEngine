Converse Chuck Taylor® All Star® Classic Boot
I love these shoes. I've been wearing Chuck Taylors for years and this is a cool twist on them. I got a lot of compliments on them (including, randomly, one from a TSA officer in the security check at the MIA airport). A word of advice: like Chucks, they run big - but not as big. I wear a whole size smaller in regular Chucks but I wear a half size smaller for this pair.
These shoes are cool!  Like the other poster said, I wear them with the tongue out mostly.  People compliment me on them all the time.  Personally I think the fit is pretty good. I ordered the size I normally wear and found it to fit very well.
Shoe is really cute, but ran a half a size larger for me. Wish it hugged my ankle better. No arch support. We all know, but don t care that Converse isn't known for having any arch at all. :) Just really attractive shoes.
I got this shoe in a size 9, but it it was still half an inch too big. I love the shoe otherwise.
