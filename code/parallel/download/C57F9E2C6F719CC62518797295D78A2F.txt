Keds Champion Basic CVO
These shoes are great. My tiny yet wide width feet cheer with joy whenever it's sneaker day. I usually wear a 6.5, but these I order a 7. If you're planning to wear in the winter with double thick socks, I would absolutely size up and out.
They're a nice, basic keds shoe. They're a bit narrow in the front, so I feel like my pinkie toe is going to tear through pretty fast, but the next half-size up was too long.
The back has a lot of cup to it, so it goes completely around the heel and pushes on the tendon. I had to wear taller socks to pad the area until they softened up slightly.
I have wide feet so I was so excited to know that these pairs of Keds come in wide. Strangely, nothing seems to fit me.  I wear 8.5 so when 8.5 in the standard size was too tight, I tried the 8.5 in wide but that was too big and so was the 8. I'm so sad because I've waited for a long time for these shoes to get back in stock. 
Instead of a women's size 8, I had to order 7.5. 
They look great and are very comfy. 
The shoes have a very comfortable fit, although they feel a little large for size (0.5). I guess it's because I'm used to wearing sneakers with all that padding in vs. these Keds which don't have much of a liner. If you add thick socks, or socks of any kind, it gets snug and fits more true to size. A pair of heel guards or some other kind of sole device may help too. Even though they seem to run big, don't buy a size down because you might run the risk of getting cramp-toe. The reason why I didn't return these or a pair of pumps.
Love these sneakers! So cute with a pair of leggings. I would definitely go 1/2 a size down if I were you. At first I had to return the sneakers because they were too big but the customer service was fantastic! I didn't have to pay for return shipping either. Fantastic purchase!
