Nike Air Copius
Very disappointed. Bought these shoes specifically for running in a size I've always consistently worn. When they arrived, they ran small (pardon the pun), but I thought they'd stretch a little. That didn't happen, my feet were in pain and the shoes now unreturnable and essentially worthless. I have since switched to another brand and am very satisfied. One of the unfortunate and costly lessons of buying on-line: you can't compare.
I bought this and another shoe (Pegasus+ 28 by Nike) because they come in wide widths. The pegasus fit great, but this one felt a half-size too small in length. Other than the tight fit, it was a good value for the price (though the Pegasus is a much better running shoe).
Great shoe.  My son loves them.  I bought the shoe in two sizes to see which size fit better.  Returning the one pair was super easy! 
These shoes are very comfortable, and I would highly recommend them, but they do run on the small side. I had to return two pairs before getting the right size. They feel about a full size smaller than they should.

Tried these on at a store (size D). They are very narrow. While driving home the toes on left foot cramped up. That is how narrow they are. Not sure why the width goes D to 4E? What happened to E, 2E and 3E? No love for them I guess. Hey Nike, make your sneakers wider, guys. Who has feet that fit in the D's? Wow. Nice looking sneaks, but please widen them to regular people's feet, not some super thin foot. No one wants their feet squeezed.
