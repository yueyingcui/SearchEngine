Tretorn Skymra - Canvas
So cute! If you're okay with minimal support, I say go for it! (And if you're unsure, go with the half size up.) Unfortunately, my orthotics won't work with these, even in the larger size, so back they go.
Great shoes. Very comfortable arch support and cushioned sole. Needed a half size bigger than normal. Will definitely get another pair down the road.
I love, love, love these sneakers. They are fun and comfortable, jazzy but not too weird or plastic looking. I sized up 1/2 size into an 8 and they fit perfectly. The navy goes with just about everything. I have seriously considered ordering more identical pairs as backups once these wear out. There is not much arch support, but otherwise these are a gem.
As others have said, these run small - very narrow and snug fit, so be sure to go up at least a half size. That said, they look great on and are comfortable for less active uses. Very happy with them.
These shoes are described as medium width, but I'd say they're actually quite narrow. I ordered a half-size larger, just in case, and they were still far too narrow. 
They look good, though -- wish I could get my feet in them!
