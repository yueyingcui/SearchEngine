Converse Kids Chuck Taylor® All Star® Street Ox (Toddler/Youth)
I bought these for my 5 year old nephew. He loves them and says they're really comfortable. He usually wears a size 11, but in these he wore a 10.5.
I love my Converse. It was a little tricky getting the right size. Converse run a little long. But, it was worth a little wait. I wear them all the time.
Finally, some Chucks that are comfortable! They still retain the look of the original Chucks, but they have some padding and an actual arch support. I had to buy half a size larger than I do in the old school Chucks, but overall I love them.

My four year old is stoked. These are adorable, seem to be durable, and best of all he can get them on and off by himself! I was skeptical at first, as they seemed pretty narrow and we worked hard to get them on the first couple of times, but now they are easing up. Converse run a full size larger than most other brands. Flat soled shoes like these Chuck Taylors are much better for a child's developing foot (as well as adults) as they do not interfere with the foot's natural rest and movement.
My kid loved them. I think they run about 1 size too big. I ordered them in sizes Youth 6-4.5 so my kid can try them all on and she ended up having to go with the 4.5. She's usually a Youth 5.5, so they ran large.
Why does Converse take the cheap route when including laces with their shoes.  Our grand daughter was so excited to receive her new shoes but the laces inserted by Converse were too short to tie the shoe.  Converse, if you are going to sell a product, put the right size laces in the shoe, laces should not be a major cost item in production.  Very dissatisfied with the product.  Will not be ordering Converse in the future.
