adidas Originals Kids Gazelle 2 (Infant/Toddler)
These shoes are so cute! They were true to length (I ordered a 1/2 size up and they were snug enough to fit) but a little tight across the top. Unfortunately, the velcro does wear out (pretty quickly with an 18-month old playing in the sandbox and running through the yard) - but all in all a good shoe for a few months of wear.
These sneakers are so cute. I bought them for my 6 year old grandson who just started playing tennis. He loved them. True to size and looked adorable.
Great shoes! So cute and comfortable for my daughter! Easy to get on and off and easy for her to walk in and fit true to size.
