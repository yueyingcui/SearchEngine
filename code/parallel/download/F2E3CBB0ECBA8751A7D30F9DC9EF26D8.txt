Saucony Originals Jazz Original
First, I am a woman who is often forced to wearing men's shoes because of my extraordinarily wide, flat feet. I tried these Saucony shoes and although they fit just well enough in terms of size and width, they are so lacking in arch support that I would be seriously afraid of twisting my ankle. These are definitely not for those with even mild pronation or balance problems. 
All the things you expect we're stellar with these shoes, size, fit, appearance and extra laces. However this shoe/sneaker with its minimalistic design and sole construction give you a resilience and agility that's really substantial. Many athletic shoes kind of transmit a floppy feeling with their large imprint. No so with the "Originals". They're great for walking, running, gym workouts and full days on your feet!
