SKECHERS Heisman
These are comfortable, do-it-all leather shoes. They are slip-ons that do not make me look like an old man. The fit seems true to size or slightly smaller. I have worn a 10 for many years but it seems all 10's are too big nowadays and I take a 9Â½ in these and most other shoes.
Just a nice, good-looking, comfortable shoe. There's a little more cushioning in the sole of this shoe than there is in most Skechers (Skechers calls it "Relaxed Step"), so it feels a little tight. I'd recommend a half-size larger than what you usually wear.
