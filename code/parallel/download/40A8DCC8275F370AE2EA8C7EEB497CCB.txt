Diadora Scudetto LT TF W
I ordered these, and they're black, not white. And mens sized...though I thought they were women's.
I bought size 9.5 for my 15 year old daughter who wears a 9.5 in regular shoes. Immediately when she put them on she said they felt really tight. I told her that cleats/turf shoes should fit snug and since they're real leather, they should form to her foot. She wore them around the house for 3 hours and said they felt great after that. She's played in them about 3 times now and loves them.
