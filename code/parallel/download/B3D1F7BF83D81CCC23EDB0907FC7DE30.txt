These are really good for foot support, slight but decent arch support, and very padded. Buy a half size up, as the padding takes up space. 

This is a great shoe. Good fit and the strap really gives you that little extra support needed. Shoe fits true to size. Very comfy.
This shoe is great! A bit larger than marked though. Order a half size down if you can. This aside, it is a very comfortable shoe. Great support for your ankle because they are a bit higher. Definitely recommend!
