adidas Barricade Team 2
I ordered a half size larger than I normally wear to accommodate an insert and they fit perfectly. Overall the support is excellent. Great shoe, and as a bonus, they look good.

I've played with these shoes for about 3 weeks now.  They are very stable on the court and have been quite quick and light.  I've played on both hard and Har-Tru and the shoe performs well on both.  The soles are still in great shape and show no signs of excessive wear.  I have the most average 9.5 foot and the fit is very true to size.  My only gripe would be that the lace grommets are a little tight making the laces stick a little.  Not a big deal, just something to get use to.
