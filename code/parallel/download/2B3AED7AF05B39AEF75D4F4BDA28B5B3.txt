Spira Odyssey
I had just received these shoes, and the initial look and feel was great. However, I quickly realized that the shoe was not true to size. I always wear a 10 in any athletic shoe I buy, and the fit is true to size. This shoe was at least half size too small. The width as well, is too narrow. I typically have worn a medium or D width shoe. I wanted to give the shoe a real chance, with the wave spring and all. So, I am doing an exchange for a 10.5 size. I have never had to go to that size before.
These shoes are extremely comfortable. I work 12 hour shifts and my feet feel great at the end of the day.  They are true to size (I have wide feet) and require no break-in period.
This is a well-fitting shoe. I've got size 12 feet which are narrow-to-medium in width, and the width on these is great. The sole does energize your step and is comfortable right from the start. I do wish the tongue was just a touch longer, it doesn't slip down, but it just barely comes above the lace area.
These are great shoes. Walking is much easier in them, you just kind of spring along.  The fit is true to size, good arch support, and nice looking. Lots of reflector.  I would definetly order them again.
