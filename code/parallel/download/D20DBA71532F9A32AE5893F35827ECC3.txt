Converse Kids Chuck Taylor® All Star® Simple Slip (Infant/Toddler)
Love these sneakers! I wanted a sneaker that would be easy to put on my very busy toddler. These are perfect! The color is awesome! I have another pair in the next size up waiting for us.
Love these shoes! The velcro opening makes a world of difference...these are nothing like the slip-on ones that just have elastic on the tongue, you can actually get these on a little one's foot very easily. The violet color is awesome, something different than the standard pink everything. They do run about a size big, so you may want to size down when ordering. My daughter wore her first pair at 12 months, and loved them. No problems for her walking in them either! Everyone compliments on her shoes...too adorable to pass up. Order every size!
Awesome! These shoes are adorable & go with just about anything from jeans & a sweatshirt to dresses & capris! Super easy to get on her feet as they open up at the tongue! They do run about 1 size larger than other brands, so I would suggest buying a size down.
