Onitsuka Tiger by Asics Fencingâ„¢
I love these shoes and want them now in other colors. They do have a slight arch built inside so if you are flat-footed this may take some getting used to. I ordered half a size up and they fit great.
I ordered the black/white pair 5.5 size. Initially, it felt loose/bigger and I was debating to return it but I kept it because it looked nice. Once it was broken in, it feels comfortable and doesn't feel too loose. It's supple and easy to walk. The mesh also keeps my toes cool (I noticed it when it was cold outside).
