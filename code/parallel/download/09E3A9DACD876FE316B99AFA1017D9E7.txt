Sperry Kids Halyard (Youth)
Excellent shoes.  Muted, washed look blue goes with everything.  Fits true to size and comfortable.  Relatively flat inside so if you need extra support may need thin arch supports found in any superstore.  Which is what my son did.  Overall a great pair of shoes. 
This shoe is very cute for my 16 year old. It ran a whole size larger and I sent it back and got a size down. The shoe bed is soft but has no arch. Not great for my special needs son but the shoe is so cute I kept them. He loves them and I want him to look good and feel good about what he is wearing.
Great look; very comfy and the price is right. I will say that they run about a 1/2 size too big. Even though they are a little "roomy", couldn't pull them back off because they were just so comfy! Plus, I love the stonewashed, vintage look.
