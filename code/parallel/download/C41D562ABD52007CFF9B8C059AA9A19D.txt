I wear a size 11 and these were about a 1/2 size too small.  No arch support. They were a nice looking athletic shoe, but I wasn't confident the upper material would last.
Loved this shoe. Just what I was looking for.  Nice color, very lightweight, length fit perfectly, toe area fit perfectly, although it was cut too narrow across the top.  I was really disappointed. I wear an 8.5 M and have never had to go up or down on a shoe.  A larger size would have been too big.  Unfortunately I had to return them.
