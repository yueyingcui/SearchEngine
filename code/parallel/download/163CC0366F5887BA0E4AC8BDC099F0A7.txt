Puma Kids Tune Cat B V (Infant/Toddler)
I bought these for my 18mo daughter. They are true to size and fit her perfectly. I like the way they Velcro, and I think she does, too. They aren't big, wide and clunky like some brands out there. She never trips over them and loves to have them on her feet. I only wish they came in pink...
These are very stylish shoes. My toddler immediately put them on and declared that he could jump a lot higher now. My only complaint is that they seem to run a little small, perhaps by half a size. I had intended to buy ahead, but they pretty much fit him perfectly now, and there was no sending them back once he had seen them. Oh well.
Bought these for my 2 year old son. He's been wearing puma's since he was born and never have a problem with them. The size is very true to size and whenever they get dirty, I can scrub with a brush and the leather/material never gets damaged or worn. I've cleaned off grass stains from these shoes and they never look worn (I use dish soap and a soft brush or toothbrush to clean them. For light dirt, I can just use a baby wipe!) great shoe!
Love these shoes. In fact, I love them so much after our son outgrew them I bought them again in a larger size!
I absolutely loved these shoes when I unpacked them. The quality of materials is outstanding. The overall look and feel is superb. I can't tell yet how they perform because they are so far too big for my boy (I intentionally bought them two sizes bigger), but from their look I'm pretty sure they will serve well when he is grown up enough to wear them.
