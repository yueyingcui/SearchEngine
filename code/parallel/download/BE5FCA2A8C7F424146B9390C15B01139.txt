Nike Zoom SD 3
Great shoes but they run about 1/2 size small. Good support and spinning surface.
The shipping for this shoe was extremely fast. The only issue I had was the shoe is cut extremely small. If you get this shoe, please order a size larger. I am a female who wears a size 11 and I ordered a 9 1/2. It was to small. I wore them twice but couldn't endure the pain. Many compliments though.
Nice shoe for a runner.  I needed to go a half size bigger in order for the fit to be right.
