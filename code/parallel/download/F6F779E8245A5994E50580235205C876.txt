Capezio Kids Mary Jane - 3800C (Toddler/Youth)
Very cute tap shoes for my 2-year-old little dancer! However, they did seem to run 1/2 size small and they were very narrow. My daughter normally wore a size 7B, but I had to order a 7.5W in these.
1) Color: Matte black instead of the usual shiny black color. 2) Fit: Great for medium width feet. Also, great for those that do not know how to tie their shoes laces because these shoes come with Velcro straps where as a lot of other tap shoes come with bow ties. 3) Style: Better than the other types of tap shoes in that it can be dressy or casual. My daughter sometimes doesn't suit up for class but, it still goes with all of her 'street' clothes. 4) Quality: 5 stars. I buy a half size bigger so it can last longer and with the Velcro straps it is easier to keep feet inside the shoe.
My daughter adores these shoes.  She already had the Capezio ballet slippers, so I ordered these in the same size.  Perfect fit!
Great tap shoe that is true to size. Easy for my daughter to put on by herself.
