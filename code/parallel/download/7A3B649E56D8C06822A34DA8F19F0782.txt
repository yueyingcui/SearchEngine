adidas Originals adiRacer Remodel Lo
Great comfort and fit true to size -- not the best for long walks but great for driving and fun wear.
At first I thought these were rigid and uncomfortable but it only took a day of wearing them to realize I was wrong. They scuff easily up front, but the great sole makes up for the minus. Adidas always fits if I order the same size.
Adidas states that they do not make any width B narrow shoes.  These Remodel Lo sneakers are very narrow and can pass as a B size when lacing them up tightly.
