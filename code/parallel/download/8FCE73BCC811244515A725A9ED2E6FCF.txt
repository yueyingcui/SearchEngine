Vivobarefoot Breatho Trail L 
I bought these Breatho Trail shoes because they're easy to pack for working out when traveling. I don't do barefoot running. Although I wear a 41 in Dansko clogs and Josef Seibel, I need a 42 in the Breatho Trail shoe for length. My choice came down to the Vivobarefoot Breatho Trail L in 42, the Merrell Barefoot Pace Glove in 11 Wide (10 was too short), and the New Balance WT20v2 in 10 Wide. I have a high instep and bursitis in one heel, and I pronate. The footbed in the Breatho Trail is wider than that of the Pace Glove, especially at the arch. The Pace Glove has an elastic inset that forms part of the back of the shoe, and it hits me in the area that has bursitis. I felt the seams or something under my arch in the New Balance WT20v2. Overall the Breatho Trail feels the best for me. Note that both the Breatho Trail and Pace Glove have horizontal elastic straps in the tongue; the insets in the Breatho Trail are encased in the tongue fabric and not visible. In the correct shoes sizes, I feel the elastic working but it doesn't pinch the top of my foot. (That's actually more than I can say for my newest Danskos; I hope they stretch over time.)
I love these shoes! I ordered one size smaller than my Vibram Five Fingers and they fit great. I wore them at our last Spartan race up and a down muddy and wet mountain and they held to the ground like champs! My husband has them too and he agrees they are the best trail shoe! They are still a minimalist shoe though, so if you've never worn minimalist shoes, take your time getting used to these babies, don't go run a 5k the first time you slip these on.
