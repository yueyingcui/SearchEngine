Reebok Lifestyle Freestyle Hi
These are very narrow, but they seem comfortable. They run half a size small. I might try the next size up because it feels like there is a lot of support with these shoes which have sort of boxing style to them. I think they will look good with skinny jeans and be supportive enough for light hiking, but they are very narrow and definitely run small.
