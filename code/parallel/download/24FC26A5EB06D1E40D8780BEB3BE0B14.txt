PUMA PUMA Suede 
Very cute but they need an insole to make them more comfortable. I ordered them in 6.5 for women but found them to be too short so I will go half a size up. 
I bought these for my boyfriend and we both think they are great. Super cute and old-school style. Color just as pictured. He seemed to think they were true to size.
I own an older Puma suede same color. I ordered a replacement for my worn out pair that I love but the new ones were too small? Going to order a 1/2 size larger, hope it works out.
I bought these shoes for my sister for her birthday. She loves them. They were true to size. And she says they are comfortable and nice looking. 
I just got my shoes yesterday and they are exactly as described. I did buy them 1/2 size larger and I have narrow heels and wider toe area and they feel a little tight but I think they will get looser with wear.
Bought these for my boyfriend and they fit him perfectly. They were true to size and we saw them the next week at a sporting goods store for more.
