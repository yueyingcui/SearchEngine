Roxy Lido Slip On
Fantastic shoe -- comfortable & stylish. I needed a half size smaller because my regular size was slipping off.
Love these sneakers.  They are so comfortable and are true to size.  I just ordered another pair but in a different color.
I was looking for a pair of comfy summer slip-ons and these fit the bill perfectly! I got the moss green and the color is more grayish than it looks online, but still cute. They are very comfortable, the soles are nice and squishy. I ordered my usual size and they fit well.
Awesomely comfortable shoes. Very true to size. And they last through wash after wash. I recommend them highly.
Love this shoe! Super cute! I usually wear a size seven and did order a 7 and had to put gel heel support in cause a little big but a 6 would have been too small!
These are great shoes. Very comfortable and they go with a lot. The sizing is a bit off. I originally ordered a 9 (my usual size) but they were too big. I downsized to an 8.5, but then ordered another pair of 8.5 in a different color and they were too small. 
I absolutely love these shoes!  I have even come back to purchase two more pairs in different patterns.  They are very comfortable and can be worn all day.  They look fantastic with shorts, capris or a summer skirt.  They run true to size and I highly recommend these slip on shoes.
