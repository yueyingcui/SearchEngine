PUMA King Indoor IT
Perfect Indoor show.
I wish I'd had a pair of these when I was in my prime. The leather is excellent and really allows you to feel the ball. I usually wear a 10.5, but in this shoe the 10.5 was too small and I had to get an 11. Order a half size larger than you usually wear and you'll be fine. This shoe is everything an indoor soccer shoe should be. It's the best money I ever spent.


This is one of the top indoor shoes available! It is expensive, but if you play lots, it's worth it.
Because it's "K" leather the shoe tends to stretch a bit as they get worked in. Tight at first, but quickly fit like a glove after just a couple of games. I got a half size smaller than I usually wear and it's perfect.

Soccer Shoe,,,not for me.
Great shoe, love the look. I do not use it for soccer. It is comfortable except it is a narrow shoe and you have to order a half to a full size larger. I bought it because I liked the way it looks and it's comfort level is rising because it is past it's break in period.
