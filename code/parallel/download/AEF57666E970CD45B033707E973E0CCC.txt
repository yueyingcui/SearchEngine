Keen Kids Coronado Print (Toddler/Youth)
Oh, these are just as cute in person as they are in the picture! And the pink, grey and turquoise seems to match with so much of the colors that are in right now for little girl clothes, so they go with everything. My four-year-old has had to practice to figure out how to get them on by herself, but in the meantime I'm able to help her one-handed while I hold my infant. She says they're very comfy and I trust that they'll hold up well. My daughter has pretty narrow feet, but I don't think that's an issue. I want this shoe in my size!
Keens rock! For an active grandboy of 2 who climbs, crawls and kicks, these shoes are indestructible! He sizes out of them long before they wear out. Also, due to his high instep, they fit his little tootsies so well! And he's into 'owls' right now so these are very timely!
