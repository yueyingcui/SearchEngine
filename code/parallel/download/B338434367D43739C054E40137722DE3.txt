Biom Natural Motion by ECCO BIOM Lite Mary Jane
True to size and true to Ecco's comfort. The absolute most comfortable shoes for walking up and down San Francisco's hills.
I was hesitant to order these shoes since many European styles don't quite fit my 8.5 size foot, but the size 39 fits perfectly. I wore them around the house for about 3 days to be sure they would work and I absolutely love them! Wish they came in more colors (like taupe) because I would order them in several colors. I'll be taking these on a long upcoming trip and they will be my main shoe every day.
I'm on my feet a lot and have been looking for a summer-type comfortable shoe. I read others reviews online about these and made my decision. These are so comfortable. They are true to size. 
I highly recommend these if you are looking for lightweight comfort.
I love these. I have narrow feet and wear a size that basically doesn't exist: 10.5 narrowish. It seems like these would work for medium width, too. For me, the strap tightens nicely and that makes these really comfy. My work is casual so I can wear them to work after walking to work. I think they could have made them a little nicer looking but the appearance is OK. Also, I don't get the arch support or no arch support and thingy as that sounds luge a value judgment and I don't want arch support.
