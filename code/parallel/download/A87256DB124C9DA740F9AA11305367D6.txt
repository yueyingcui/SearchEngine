Dunham Shoreline
The Dunham Shorelines are decently respectable. Attractive "boat shoes." Quite comfy, too. (Read on for my minor nit to pick.) I wear a 10.5 4E, and I was pleased to find these in my size / width. I am giving them 4 Stars on comfort (and 5 Stars on everything else), because I feel they're just a wee bit long for 10.5. I suspect if I return them for 10, those will be a wee bit short. So I am leaving well enough alone. Width is perfect.
Great looking shoe.  I wear a 10.5 EEE and ordered the 11 4E (out of my size).  While it was comfortable it looked too boxy in my opinion.  
Very pleased. I have a very hard to find size problem, but this shoe is perfect. Excellent shipping also.
I bought these shoes because I needed shoes to put an orthotic in. Also these are one of only a few boat shoes that comes in narrow sizes. 
The toe box is nice and roomy.

Very comfortable. Great size selection. The soles grip like glue. It is after all a boat shoe.

PERFECT! Exactly what I was looking for.
These shoes were exactly what I was looking for! The size was perfect - the shoes are nicer than they look in the picture. I could not be happier. And, I had them on my doorstep in less than 24 hours later! WOW!
