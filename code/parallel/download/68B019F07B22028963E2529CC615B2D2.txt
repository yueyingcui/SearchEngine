Ryka Dash
Very comfy shoes. Unfortunate that they do not come in a wide width! Had to send them back because they were not wide enough! Thought if I ordered 1/2 size up it would work - but not this time!
Very lightweight but good support. They hold up well for Jazzercise and step aerobics. And they are cute! I always buy a half size up in Ryka.
I purchased Dash by Ryka to perform low-impact aerobics.  They are very light and comfortable.  However, I had to add a more supportive insole, as I have very "flat" feet. I wear a 6.5, and even with socks, they fit me true to size. Hope this helps!
Fit good.  I'm a pronator and these seem to be flat enough, so that won't happen.  I got 1/2 size larger than I wear, to make sure they were wide with enough toe room.  Dark color does make my feet look larger.
These barely are okay - usual size is almost too small and there is an odd bump in the sole of one.
