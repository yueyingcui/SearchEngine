ASICS Gel-KinseiÂ® 4
They fit true to size, I have a neutral foot and these are perfect for running and training.

I really liked the style of these shoes but felt they were not true to size. Most of my workout shoes are Asics but for some reason these were much more narrow than my previous pairs. These shoes are definitely only "running" shoes. I thought I would be able to use these shoes for various workouts but when I wore them on the elliptical, my feet would go numb immediately and were not comfortable while taking kickboxing or zumba classes. They did feel comfy when I was on the treadmill but since I switch up my workouts, I need a universal pair of workout shoes. I wanted to keep the shoes but for the amount of money I spent, they had to go back.
