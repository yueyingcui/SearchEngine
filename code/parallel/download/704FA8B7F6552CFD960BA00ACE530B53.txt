New Balance WW512
I didn't care for the squishing sound that the sole of this shoe makes. The arch also did not fit my foot. Other than that, it was a decent pair of shoes. It was not my first or second choice but Zappo is really low on my size in black walking shoes. 
These shoes were not true to size (length). I ordered them in an 8 1/2 which I've worn for years. Other NB styles in this size fit just fine- I could barely get my foot into this shoe. I would suggest ordering at least a 1/2 size larger than usual.
