Globe Kids Motley Mid (Youth)
My son loves these shoes. He says they are very comfortable and great for skateboarding. I did have to send back the first pair and get a bigger pair because they run a size small. 
Nice looking shoe. Did have to order one size larger. Much more comfortable than vans or etnies.  Dad has globe haslams and finds them very comfortable for every day use.
