PUMA SE Vulc
I usually have problems with shoes - I have wide feet that usually fit somewhere in between a 12 and a 13 - not to mention I have flat feet, so I need some sort of support or my feet hurt like mad after too long. These Pumas were some of the very few shoes that felt great from the second I put them on. I got a size 12 and they fit perfectly. They weren't too narrow (which is a problem I have with most shoes) and they held enough support that my feet feel very comfortable even after a full day of wearing them. In conclusion, they were great. Comfortable shoes that look pretty terrific.
These are nice shoes. They're really comfortable. They don't feel too sturdy though, but then again fly shoes aren't meant to last. However, the lack of sturdiness adds to the comfort, and I'm sure these shoes will last long. They ran a half size big though.
