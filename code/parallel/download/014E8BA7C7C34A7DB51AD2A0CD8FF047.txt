The color is kind of a smoky grey-blue, which is really very pretty. They are true to size and very soft. The toes do get scuffed up if you have a crawler scooting around outdoors, but thatâ€™s to be expected from any soft leather.
These shoes are well made, soft and very cute. I ordered up because my son's feet are pretty plump and his size was a bit snug.
Totally adorable and comfortable. Harder to get on than the sandals. Maybe that has to do with the chubby baby feet/ankles. I would go a size up because of it.
