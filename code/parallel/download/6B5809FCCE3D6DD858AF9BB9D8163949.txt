Easy Spirit Romy
I have been using these shoes for my morning 2 mile walk for about a month now. They are comfortable and are not showing any signs of wear.  I use SmartFeet insoles and padded socks, so I ordered a half size up. At this point, I am very pleased with my purchase.
I love these shoes! I bought them to wear on a trip to Las Vegas as I was planning on doing a lot of walking on the Strip. The shoes were comfortable right out of the box. Wore them in Vegas for 5 days walking the hot streets during the day and night for miles, as well as some short jaunts at Red Rock Canyon. The shoes were comfortable to walk in, caused no blisters or sore spots on my feet, and my feet never felt tired or burned as they would have with my regular sneakers. First pair of shoes I've had where I could walk for hours and not have aching feet. I have the beginnings of a bunion on my left foot and usually after a day of walking, I have shooting pains in that foot. These shoes even prevented that from happening. The fit of these shoes was great. I'm a size 5B and sometimes have trouble getting shoes to fit my foot well, but these shoes fit my foot perfectly. They are supportive and fit snugly enough to feel supportive but not so snug that you feel constricted wearing them. Plus they are a nice looking shoe. I highly recommend these shoes.
These are very lightweight sneakers. They provide total comfort right out of the box with no break-in required. They run true to size. I love them and will buy them again.
I love this shoe. I bought it to wear to Disney World with my young grandsons, and it worked GREAT! My feet felt great all day with all the walking. It was great to be able to get them in my actual size 11 Narrow, which is near to impossible to find anywhere.

These shoes are comfortable. The wide size was what I needed after my foot surgery.
