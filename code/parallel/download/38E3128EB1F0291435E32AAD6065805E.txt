Nike Kids Dart 9 ALT (Toddler/Youth)
These sneaks are great for my 5 year old daughter. Easy to put on and comfortable. They do run big - 1/2 to 1 size larger. Also, if your child had very narrow feet these might not be a great choice as there's no ability to pull the laces to tighten the sneakers.
