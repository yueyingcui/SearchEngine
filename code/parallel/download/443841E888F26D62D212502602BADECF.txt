PUMA Voltaic 3
This is a good, comfortable, and stylish shoe. If that is what you are looking for, then put them in your cart and buy them. They are lighter than I expected and the size is true. The color is eye catching, but can't be worn with everything. Give yourself time to break them in though. Haven't done any long runs yet; can't rate durability. However, I am satisfied with this product, no question about it.
This shoe looks great on and feels comfortable and seems true to size. It is a well constructed shoe. I am very pleased with this shoe.
I have traditionally been a Nike wearer and then recently switched to Under Armour. It is not the quality I expected. I asked for these Pumas for Christmas. They are great shoes, very comfortable, the size is true (12M) and the tongue is sewn in so it is like putting socks on. They are great shoes that are definitely recommend.
I decided that I was going to buy some new running shoes. I had some money to set aside to just get what I want. I liked these so much that ended up ordering a few different color combination! I have a hard time finding styles I like but these are great. They fit true to size for me. Not a wide shoe but not too narrow either. The soles are thicker than what you see in the pics. Light and comfortable.
These shoes are super comfortable. I ordered the size I usually wear and they fit perfectly. Really nice looking. I love them.
First of all, I'm a woman and normally wear a size 9. I found these in a men's 6 (w 8.5) and they fit wonderfully so far, though a half-size up wouldn't hurt. These are really cool looking shoes, which I love - who wouldn't? Generally, though, the coolest-looking shoes (Nike Shox, Reebok Zigtech) seem to be extremely lacking in comfort, which I can't compromise. I am standing and walking for at least 11 hours a day, so I need comfort and support. These offer both! I definitely recommend them to anyone wanting a very cool pair of shoes that are also quite comfy.
