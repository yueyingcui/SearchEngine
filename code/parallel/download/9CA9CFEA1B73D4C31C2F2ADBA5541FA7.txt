Dr. Martens 1461 3 Eye Shoe
Love this shoe! So glad I found it here before it sold out. When I saw it in Elle editorial I knew it would probably sell out fast. Rally nice shape and crazy comfortable. The fit is better than other Dr. Martens I have had. Wish their sizing was more consistent so I wouldn't have to try 2 sizes every time. I wear a true 8.5 and the UK6 US8 fits perfectly. In the classic style I always had to go up a size.
