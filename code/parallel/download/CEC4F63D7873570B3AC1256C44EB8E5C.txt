Element Topaz
The shoe looks and feels great. Amazing look. I bought it in size 12 in the "Newspaper" color. Definitely fits my foot like a true size 12. The only problem with this shoe is that excessive walking/standing really does a number on your foot because of how flat they are. I stood at a concert for a couple hours and my feet were literally dying after the concert. I usually wear bigger skate shoes for the comfort while standing at concerts. I'd definitely buy this shoe if you spend most your day sitting or chilling around instead of standing.
Shipping was extremely fast, then what I've expected. I loved the design and the how it's feather light. I bought size 9 1/2 and it fit perfectly. However my feet are long but not wide, so it felt kind of loose a little. Besides that, I love this shoe. I bought the forest gray one, but didn't expect the shoe to be very green. Under a sunlight it's very green. This is one of the most comfortable shoes that I've worn in my life.
I got these shoes to wear to work because it's a more casual environment. The first day, I got tons of complements. The laces aren't needed, but add greatly to the aesthetic. It fits true to size with a little expansion if caught in the rain. That happens to almost any canvas shoes, however. If you're looking for an easy going casual flat then this is your guy.
If you love low profile shoes, this is the shoe for you. They are true to size, fit like a glove, and it's super light. If your clothes are ice cream, then this shoe is the cherry on the top.
