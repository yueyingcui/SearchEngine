Pearl Izumi Womens X-Alp Enduro III
I teach indoor cycle and have used these 3 or 4 times. Love them. You can walk without the clip clicking against the floor. I am a solid size 9 -- I ordered a 42 in these, and the fit is great. They are a little bulky in the style department, so I sort of feel like I am wearing those big black shoes they make servers wear in some chain restaurants. But. Oh well. The turquoise trim adds a little interest.
I am a size 8, or usually a 38. Thankfully I ordered a size 40! They fit like a glove. I have never seen a sizing so wrong. Beware. Otherwise, these are best shoes ever. They are great for mtb as well.
Ordered size 38 for 7.5 shoe size, at least 2 sizes too small. Will reorder a larger size because it is an awesome shoe!
