Heelys Fade (Toddler/Youth/Adult)
These shoes are snug on my son, and after begging for them, he has only worn them once. I had read that they ran small, but did not want to go up a full size, thought it would be too big then. wish they sold half sizes.
These were way too small for my son. I wish I had read the reviews that said to order a size up. I returned them and am waiting for the correct size.
