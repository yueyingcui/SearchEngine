New Balance M1080v2
I have been purchasing NB running shoes for 25 years (and more recently trail shoes) because NB has accommodated wide sizes. Previously, always the most comfortable shoes. This is the first pair that are not true to the previous fits, and I had to return. It is at least half size too small, maybe full size. I compared the M1080's to my existing NB 760's and the arch appeared about an inch closer to the heal. My toe hit the end of the shoes.
