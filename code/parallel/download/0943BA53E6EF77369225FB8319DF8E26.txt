Caterpillar Shelk
The look great with jeans and shorts, excellent for walking over irregular terrain, I just walked 4 hours in Antigua Guatemala over cobble stones and they were supportive and comfortable, I was still tired, yes but not as tired when I used tennis shoes. I've had them for over 3 weeks now and nothing is wrong with them even though I bought them slightly smaller than the regular size I used, still they hold quite good. Be careful with the size, they run big.
