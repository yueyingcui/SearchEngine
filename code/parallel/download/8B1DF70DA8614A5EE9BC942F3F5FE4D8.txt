Puma Kids Tune Cat B V Inf (Infant/Toddler)
We love these Puma shoes for our son! They have nice flexible/softer soles (great for little feet) and hold up very well. We have purchased four pairs so far, as he grows out of one we simply move to the next size. We tried normal Nike type tennis shoes; he had such a difficult time walking in them because of the very hard soles. I would highly recommend this shoe for your little one.

I actually felt this shoe ran almost one and a half sizes larger than normal. I have always bought Stride Rites for my son, but saw this style and loved it. We ordered an 11 but it was so tight on him that we ordered a 12.5 which fit perfectly with just a little bit of wiggle room. I'm not sure if this tends to be how Puma usually runs. While the style of the shoe is nice, it is not very sturdy. My son runs around outside all day and after just a couple weeks the front is very scuffed up and has broken in a bit.
These shoes in toddler size 11 do not bend. They are also not lightweight. I would not recommend these shoes for a little boy (age 3). 
Very stylish. Nice fit guide on the removable footbed so you can tell if you got the right size. Very easy to put on and take off since the tongue of the shoe hinges very close to the toe. But, why only 3 stars? Except at the ball of the foot, the sole of the shoe is absolutely rigid. It doesn\'t flex or twist at all. My 2-year old was walking like Frankenstein\'s monster with these on. Returning these for a pair of Simple Doodles or similarly flexible shoe. Puma makes some nice flexible shoes with thin soles for adults, but the concept didn\'t scale down correctly to the kids\' line of shoes.
