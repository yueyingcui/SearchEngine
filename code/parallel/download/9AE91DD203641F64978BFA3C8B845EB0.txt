Saucony Kilkenny XC4 (Spike)
Bought these for my daughter to run in for cross country. She wears a 9, but these were too small/tight. Sadly, had to return, and bigger sizes were sold out. Interesting though, these are the only style shoe Saucony makes for running cross country, that are for moderate pronators.
