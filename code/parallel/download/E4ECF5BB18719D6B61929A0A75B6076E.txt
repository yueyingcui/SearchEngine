Converse Kids Chuck Taylor® All Star® 3 Strap (Toddler/Youth)
I love these shoes! I bought them for my daughter for school and she loves them too. It's easy for her to put them on and take them off because they are Velcro. Converse run big so I suggest getting a size smaller than your actual size.
We have been buying these shoes for years. They are great for kids who don't have the skills or time for shoe tying. They last just long enough - they start to wear out right when the kids are ready to go up a size! They do fit slightly large.
These are a great way to make velcro cool. My 8 year old wants the ease of velcro but not necessarily the look. Converse comes through again with an easy twist on an old classic. He has a high arch and an average width foot. The sneakers fit great. I bought them in his current size and they seem to have a little room to grow without being too large. My experience with Converse is that they usually run just a little large as is the case with these... not enough that I would go down a size. They are super cute and look great with everything. My son loves them.
I got my 5 year old these shoes black and white. He loves them hes normally a size 13 but I went down to size 12 and they fit great! Love the three Velcro straps. Hes had them on for about a hour now and no complaints here! Def a good buy!
These are awesome school shoes. They go with all of my daughter's uniforms and they fit great. They run big so order a size smaller.
These run big! Like a full size or at least half a size. Once we got the right size my daughter loved them.
