Stride Rite Austin Lace (Toddler)
I ordered half a size up from the size of his old shoes, but they seem too small. I am ordering another pair a full size up.
Watch sizing - 
Be careful on the sizing. My child is a true 4.5 narrow and when the shoe arrived (I ordered 4.5 Medium) the width seemed fine but the shoe was too short. I've returned and waiting for the 1/2 size larger. I suspect the shoe runs narrower and smaller than usual but they're great!

Great everyday school shoe!
White looks great with khakis and jeans. Very comfortable quality shoe--white leather cleans well. Can also be worn for gym class, but I would recommend a lighter-weight sneaker on gym days. Purchased this shoe in a wide size--fit was perfect.

Great Boy's all round shoe - 
The extra width is a great help for my son and they fit him very well -- they are true to size -- we are very happy with them. He wears them to school and to church.

Fantastic shoes in wide size - 
I bought these shoes for my fifth grade son because of the wide size but the looks and quality are fantastic. 

Same shoe - 
Purchase this shoe in 2/04. Grandson(age 6) didn't wear until after Easter. Shoe busted at both big toe. Ordered same shoe, same size but price increase from $39.95 to $43.95

Basic Black - 
My kids wear uniforms to school and this year are aloud to wear gymshoes as long as they are plan black or white. These shoes are perfect. Not only do they come in wide sizes the inside material also lets your feet breath. They even don't look half bad with the uniform either. I will be buying the same shoe again for my son when he out grows the ones hes in now.

Wide sneakers for boys - 
I wish I could find more "WIDE" sizes for boys. Stride rite is about the only brand that carries them and they always have good quality. If you could add more WIDE widths for CHILDREN that would be great.
