PUMA El Rey Slip-on Nylon Wn's
I love these shoes! I normally wear an 8 but I got an 8Â½ because I read some reviews saying they were a bit snug. I definitely recommend getting these half a size up or else they will be too small. I really like these shoes.
Awesome shoes! I always have to buy half size bigger with Pumas they tend to run small. I'm a 6 1/2 and I have to buy seven They look great with skinny jeans and they are true fit! VERY COMFY!
I just got these in black. Overall, I like them. The only thing is that a lot of my foot shows, and I like to wear socks so I'll have to only wear black socks. But they are true to size, just slightly narrow. I got a 7 1/2 and it fits fine. The back is a little uncomfortable right now but I haven't broken them in yet. They're cute though, and they have a comfortable sole.
