Nike Sweet Classic High
I bought this shoe for my 14 year old son. He likes them a lot and they fit perfectly. Appeared to be true to size. I also love that they are delivered so promptly!

Great shoes. Classic design. I read the reviews on having to buy a size slightly larger and it was well healed advice as I am a 10.5 and bought 11 and they fit just right. Takes a second to break them in so a blister or two is the collateral on looking good! Also, I got this inadvertently very muddy one day and wiped them clean again with just water and cloth. Good as new again.
