Diadora Maracana TF
I was looking for a replacement for my worn out Diadora Brasil turf shoes.  But the Maracana's seemed about 1/8" to 1/4" narrower across the ball of the foot.  I have size EE width feet, and although it seemed the leather might stretch out (and other reviewer's mentioned it would), it just seemed too tight on my feet (they were bulging over the sole of the shoe) and too much to expect.  I did order the D width, so one might say there's no surprise here.  But there is variability in "D" width, and I would say these are on the narrow side of "D".  Rather than risk being uncomfortable wearing them for a while and then not being able to return them, I decided to return them right away.  It's too bad, it's a great looking shoe and seemed well made, just wished it came wider.
