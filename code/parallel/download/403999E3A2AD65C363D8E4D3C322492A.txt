ASICS GEL-EvolutionÂ® 6
Having more than just overpronation but a serious problem with a thickened tendon, a crack/hole about the size of 2 pencil eraser tips on my heel bone (the calcaneus) and an overlarge instep muscle that pinches the nerve bundle near the ankle... causing a tremendous amount of constant pain night and day, these shoes have given me a great deal of comfort. Asics has always been my favorite brand because of it's breathability, longevity and lightness... but this is especially important for motion control shoes (which weigh a LOT because of necessary features, and cost a lot, and so need to last a LONG time). 
Now I can walk around a store for a bit and sit in the car for an hour's drive without wanting to scream. A 3 hours concert this week was manageable. I can't say how grateful I am. 

Absolute best running shoes I've ever worn! I'm on my 3rd pair of these. I wear a size 14 2E, so it's a bit tough finding a good pair of shoes that feel good, but these are the ones for me!!
FABULOUS!!!! They have great arch support for my high arches and great cushioning. I ordered 4E, and it's wide enough where I need it but hugs your ankles and back of the foot with CUSHIONED sides and back. Sooo comfortable; GREAT SHOE! I bought another pair in my size to have a spare. I have hard to fit feet, both with Neuromas, and plantar fasciitis in the right foot. These shoes are the ultimate in comfort and support. I just use them for walking and everyday use. I like the grey, neutral color too.

A good feeling shoe but was a bit big in a larger size, I have ordered a replacement one size smaller.
