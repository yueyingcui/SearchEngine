Sanuk Limelight II
This shoe can be dressed up or down. I wore it to a ballet and I wear it with jeans. The fit is somewhat smaller as the other reviews said...so I did order a half size up. However, they are stretching a bit, so I probably could have ordered a full size down and these shoes would still be fine. Either way, I love the shoe. I have many black flats but they are not as comfortable as these. Only one little sequin has fallen off...so that is really not a problem. Would love to have them in some sort of blue shade.
Shoes are so cute and so comfy! Definitely going to want to get a size larger than you need... I had to soak mine in hot water then put a thick sock on to loosen them up a bit...now they're broke in and are perfect!
These shoes are way small. I ordered a 9 because that's what size shoe I wear in 99% of my shoes. In this case my toes are literally about to bust out of the top of them.
