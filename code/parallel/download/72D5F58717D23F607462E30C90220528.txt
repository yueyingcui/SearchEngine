Merrell Kids Solo Origins (Toddler/Youth)
Super-cute shoe - it's more of a trail-runner-type shoe than an straight-up tennis shoe, but it's still really cute. Comes with 2 pairs of laces, the hot pink shown and a pair of orangish ones that match the trim on the heel. Soft and cushy inside, especially around the ankle. Seems to run true-to-size for length and fits a medium-narrow foot.
