Nike Air Speed Nubby 5/8
Pros; The Nike Air Speed Nubby is a great looking shoe, and the soles are perfect for softball, coaching and even golf. The sizing runs a little narrow so I would go a half size larger. Cons; The shoe is not very comfortable, I was disappointed by the poor quality materials and the foot support toward the heal rubs your Achilles and is uncomfortable. I was greatly disappointed with the overall comfort as a whole. I ordered a half size bigger and the fit is good but still is not a good feeling shoe.
Love these shoes. Break-in period was about one day at a semi pro football tryout. Very stiff so there is great energy transfer. Grip on artificial turf is outstanding. Fit true to size. Definitely would get another pair.
Good overall comfort and support and seems to have good wear.  They are about 1/2 size smaller than your typical Nike shoe.
Comfortable, true to size fit.  Traction on artificial turf is excellent.  I would purchase again.
