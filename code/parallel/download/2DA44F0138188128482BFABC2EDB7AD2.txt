Lacoste Meyas W
90% of my shoes are size 9 which is the size I wear normally.  I ordered a 9 in this shoe and it's about a 1/2 size too big.
I have purchased a 6.5 from 6pm.com because I was not sure that a size 6 would be true to size. I should have ordered a size 6. The mesh is not comfortable, but the shoe looks good.
