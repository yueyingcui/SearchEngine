Jambu Stowe
Loved the shoes! My size is 7 1/2 but shoes were too tight. I now am on a waiting list for size 8. Hopefully I can get them. Loved the look and feel of them. My kind of shoe!
These are very comfortable, practical and reasonably stylish shoes. They are warm and have great traction even on icy surfaces. I do wish they did not have the fuzz around the ankle (I only wear these with pants that cover this). I agree with other reviewers that they run a bit narrow, so order a size up if you have wide feet, as I do. I also have fairly high arches, but did not find that aspect of the fit to be a problem.
These are monstrously comfortable in concept - nice looking slippers masquerading as cute shoes. However, they are too narrow for my foot - a shame since I typically fit Jambu shoes without a problem. I tried them on without socks (again - so, so soft), but worry that they would really begin to smell after a while if I did that frequently. May try a larger size.
