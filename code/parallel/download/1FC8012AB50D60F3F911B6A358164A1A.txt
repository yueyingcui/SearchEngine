Superga Kids 2750 JCOT Classic (Toddler/Youth)
I am in love with Superga! Other reviewers stated that these run wide so size down, which I did and they fit great. For reference, I am a women's size 5 but bought a 34 in youth.
I ordered these for my fashion-conscious 9 year old son. We both like them. They are really well made. They seem to run small, though. I would suggest ordering a half-size larger than typically needed.
