Lowa Tempest QC
An existing review said that these felt a half size smaller than marked, so I ordered a size 10.5 instead of my usual size 10. The advice was good. They fit me perfectly at size 10.5. I inserted a green Superfeet insole to get better than the moderate arch support they came with. They look great, too. I had a pair of Lowa Tempests 8 years ago and enjoyed them. I look forward to years of good service with these as everyday shoes...work, hiking, etc. I like the little more ankle support that these come with.
