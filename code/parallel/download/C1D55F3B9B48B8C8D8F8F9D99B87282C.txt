New Balance W580v2
Great shoe and so light and comfortable to wear, especially for summer. I wear custom orthotics and always go up 1/2 size in my NB shoes and these fit just like my others.
Excellent fit and very comfy!  I usually wear a half size smaller in New Balance when compared with Nike and this was true with this pair. Really comfortable shoes though. 
I feel like I do not really need to say anything about these tennis shoes! If you have ever worn New Balance before, then you will not be surprised at how comfortable these are. If you have not ever worn this brand, I say you should start now! I love the arch support in these shoes! I have very high arches, so I need shoes that really shape to my feet. New Balance are the only shoes that I can wear all day long. I like that the colors, blue and silver, stay clean looking longer than my white ones did. Even in the bad weather of the Midwest. The size is right on, and same for the width! Buy these shoes right now! You will not be disappointed!
