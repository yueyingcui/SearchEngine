GoLite Tara Lite 2
These are light weight. 6.5 is a tad small, length-wise and the arch is off a bit. Though I really love their look, I won't reorder in larger size as I think the flip-flop rubber post inside will just be too uncomfortable and impossible to wear socks with, as I often do with enclosed shoes. I also don't see how all the straps really help adjust the fit, if you needed to adjust that much you'd pull the shoe out of shape. Wish they just made the shoe in this style without the post in it.
