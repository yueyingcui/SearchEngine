Vans Kids Classic Slip-On Core (Infant)
These are very well made and authentic looking. We always get comments, especially on the soles of the shoes because they have a cute footprint. The soles are sometime the most visible part of the shoe when he is sitting in his carseat/carrier. Have bought two pairs in different sizes so far.
These shoes are cute as can be! They are easy to put on my 3 month old’s tiny feet and I put them on him for every outing! The bottoms even have little footprints on them. I receive tons of compliments on these and will most likely purchase these in a size larger as soon as he grows out of this pair!
These are the cutest infant shoes EVER!!
Everywhere we go my 3 month old son gets compliments on these shoes! The size 3 shoe is 5 inches in size. The bottom of the shoes are cute as well, with an outline of a tiny foot on each shoe. And, when the shoes are put together, the shoe bottoms spell out "Vans". I bought my husband the same exact shoes in a men’s size. It is super adorable when they both wear their matching checkered slip-on Vans. So happy with this purchase!!!!
