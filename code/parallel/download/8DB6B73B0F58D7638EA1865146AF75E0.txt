Eastland Solstice
This is some comfortable shoe! Fit is pretty true to size. Toes were a bit snug at first, width wise, but after wearing a few hours, they seemed to shape to my feet and now are very comfortable, even without socks. Nice looking with pants or bermudas. Classic style.
I love these shoes!  They are a Sperry dupe but much, much better than the Sperrys.  The are extremely comfortable and well made, a very pretty shoe.  True to size, too.  Would definitely repurchase!
