Supra Owen

I wear a narrow size 10, so I generally have trouble finding a decent running show.
Most manufacturers stock medium width in the store, and don't bother to ship anything for
those of us with narrow feet.
I was very happy to find out that these shoes fit my feet to a 'T'.
I have two other pairs of Supra shoes and the fit is great for me.
Very stylish, unique ... not like the other major brands which everyone and their brother seems to have.
Great job Supra !!!!
This is the narrowest Supra so far. I usually wear a size 9 for the society, Society Mid, and I can squeeze a 9 in the Skytop. I had to get half a size up because they are very small and narrow in the foot area. I almost had to get a 10 for these. The material is soft and the Suprafoam is soft for your foot and provide good heel support which I like. I cannot write a review on how they hold up to the Nikes of the world because I just got them. I almost felt like they made these for female because their feet are smaller and narrower. Running shoe need room. It is not a bad thing because I bought a size 7 for my little sister.
