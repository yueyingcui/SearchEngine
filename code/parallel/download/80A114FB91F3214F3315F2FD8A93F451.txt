Pearl Izumi X-Alp Seek IV
Nice shoe, though a bit heavy for my taste, and I hate shoes with the absurd extension at the top of the heel does little to protect the tendon, just makes the thing hard to put on. The biggest problem is sizing. I wear an 8D, I bought a 42, supposedly an 8.45. More like a 7.5. Buy multiple sizes to find one that fits.
