Nike Elite
Nice shoe, will have to return for a size bigger. I have other Nike's that's a size 12 and I will order a 13 to be one the safe side!
I got a lot of compliments the few times I wore these to work and out around town, but my feet were begging for mercy every time I got home. Either my feet have grown or Nike has begun messing around with their sizing. It's a great looking shoe that I should have purchased a full size larger.
Warning, take a close look at the Obsidian color. I assumed that obsidian is black, but the color is really more of a deep navy blue. My sister verified this when I opened them up from the box. Upon looking at the high-resolution photos of the obsidian color, they even look deep navy blue there. I guess I should have looked more carefully, but thanks to the great return policy, I will just pick another color or style, but really look carefully at the pictures. They also fit about half a size too long. I do not know how comfortable they are because I returned them immediately, but I am sure that they are great.
