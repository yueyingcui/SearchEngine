New Balance Kids KB907 (Toddler/Youth)
Thank goodness for New Balance! My son has W feet, so it is always a challenge to find shoes for him. We tried a Reebok basketball shoe, but it only came in M width. The shoe was too narrow in the heel even going up a half size in length. As usual, the New Balance fit right out of box and are comfortable. My son loves them. I spent more, but he is not likely to wear them out, so they will be hand-me-down for little brother.
