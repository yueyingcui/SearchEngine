Mephisto Hurrikan
The Hurrikan's are a beautifully made shoe, but the be sure to order at least one size less than your normal size and width as they are made larger than expected. I normally wear a size 10.0 medium and ended up with a 9.5. The D is also too wide but the only width available.
I always wear 10.5, medium width.  But this shoe was far too long and wide.  A size 10, medium was sent.  This length was okay, but it is still too wide. Hence, this well-made shoe is uncomfortable.
Mephistos are perfect, of course. Strange thing about this, my normal size is 91/2D my old Mephisto pair was an 8, so I ordered 8 and its fine.
I love my Mephistos!
I bought my first pair of Mephisto shoes, model Match or equivalent, while visiting in Holland twelve years ago. My "popular brand" all-purpose shoe had just separated between the heel and footbed on a walk in Haarlem. I passed a shoe store and saw this good looking shoe in the window, stopped in and tried them on. It was love at first step!! 
I broke the Mephistos in walking around Amsterdam, Leiden and Berlin, the other shoes having been relegated to the waste bin. Never a sore spot or rub from the day I first put them on my feet!
When my Harken and later, my Timberland deck shoes became unwearable, the Hurrikan was the natural choice. I have worn the Mephisto Hurrikans on three Continents and Australia and New Zealand as well as other Mephisto models (I now own five pair including the incomparable Niels sandal).
Well, my wife couldn't stand it so she bought a pair about eight years ago. Now, Imelda (just kidding, of course!) has nine pair of her own!
You cannot find a better made, more comfortable shoe.
We are travelling to Japan in a few weeks. My new Hurrikans and my  original pair of Match will go with me!
A note on sizes: These shoes are European sized and will require a bit of patience in getting the right size for your foot. Trust me: That patience will be rewarded.
