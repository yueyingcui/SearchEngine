ASICS GEL-Tech Walker Neoâ„¢ 2
I usually have been buying size 9 in hiking boots and some running shoes...
my shoe size usually is size 8 1/2 for shoes....with the exceptional as stated prior.
This  shoe, is definitely running large.
i may try one more time... and see if a half size smaller may do the trick.
the size nine was way..to0 big.
the size 8 1/2 was way too big....
other than this...it looks like a good shoe.
My husband wore these on our trip to Paris which involved a lot of walking and his feet were very comfortable. He ended up with blisters once but I can honestly say that it would have probably happened more frequently if not for these shoes! Be sure to order a half size smaller than your typical size. We already knew this since he's worn Asics before but if you're new to the brand beware of this.
Other than having to reorder half a size larger than I wear, these are great shoes. I have been wearing New Balance 840 and 845 shoes for the last 10 years and changed because of a knee irritation and wanted to change the geometry of my walking shoes. So far the Asics seem to wear better, they are lighter, and needed no break-in, but as usual for a good walking shoe, they look bulky.
The best fitting and most comfortable sneaker I have owned. True to size fit. Great for the treadmill. No tired feet after workout.
