Nike Kids T-Run 5 (Toddler/Youth)
My 8 year old son loves these shoes so much that I picked up a pair of girls pink ones for myself a couple sizes larger.
My 5 year old really likes these shoes. He likes the soles. I got these a few months after his Shock shoes in the same size when the shocks got holes on both toes at the top.  After 1 month and daily wear, these are still in one piece.  Hoping they last until I have to get the next size up. 
These shoes are great.  My 12year old loves them.  They look exactly as shown in the image, and are true to size.  He likes shoes that have ample room in the toe box, and these are perfect.
My son was thrilled with these.  Exactly what he wanted! I did order bigger size than he usually wears as Nike tends to run smaller. But they fit perfect.
They came very fast look awesome on my son runs true to size so I'm ordering another pair!
Love, love these shoes. I bought for my 9.5 year old daughter who happily wears them every day. She really likes them and they fit true to size.

I love these shoes! I'm in my 20's but have small feet. I normally wear a woman's 5, but I had to order these a couple times... I ended up with the Kids size 4. I am very active, and I love these for running, sprinting, and other fitness classes. They don't look "too little kiddy." 

I actually ordered this for a 36 year old woman who is a size petite and it worked great! What a great pair of sneakers.
My 6-year old daughter loves these shoes.  After reading the other reviews, I was worried they would run small, so we went up about 1/2 size and they're perfect.
These shoes get noticed! Super cute - my daughter loves them. Nike sizes run a bit small so I half-sized up and they fit great!
