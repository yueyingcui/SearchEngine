Shimano SH-WM51
This was my first pair of cycling shoes. I bought them specifically for spin. So far I have worn them about a month and really like them. They fit true to size. I would recommend. I really can tell a difference in spin class.
Purchased these for use on my bike outdoors, but with the extra warm weather, have been using them for Spinning class. They seriously change your workout - definitely worth the price! I wear a 7.5-8 usually, so I bought the size 40 and they fit perfectly. They aren't super uncomfortable to walk in, either.
My first pair of cycling shoes, so I don't have any basis for comparison. With that said, I am very happy with them. I wear a women's 11 and thought the size 44 would be too big, but they are perfect. 
Nice and stiff riding shoes without being uncomfortable to walk around in between.
