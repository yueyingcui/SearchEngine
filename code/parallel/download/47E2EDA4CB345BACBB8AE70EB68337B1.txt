Nike Kids Lunar Forever (Youth)
My son loved the shoes, but we had to return them because they were too small. They do not have the size he needs in stock, but we are hoping they will soon. 
I am an adult female but I love the LunarGlide 2 style and feel and they quit making it in adult sizes. Lame! So the toebox is a bit smaller than I would like and it's not as sleek looking as previous Lunar Glide 2's but I use them for 2-3 hours every day for a variety of workouts: high impact and low impact and they are super comfortable.
