Caterpillar Argon Composite Toe
This shoe is a half size large. I'll be returning mine for the next size down. Otherwise, the sole was comfortable with good support and great flexibility. Uppers also seemed well constructed and were comfortable to wear. Toe cap may be a bit small, as I could feel the edges rubbing my big and small toes. I'll probably get the soft toe version when I re-order.
The shoes have great traction in the snow and not too bulky. They fit great, but almost feel a half size too big, but this doesn't make them uncomfortable or awkward. The shoes felt great from the first time I wore them (12 hour day) with no discomfort. The composite toe is great for not having to remove your shoes when going through metal detectors! No more steel toes for me. Have not tested the durability of the composite toe yet.
