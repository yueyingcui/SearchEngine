Easy Spirit Litewalk
These shoes run smaller and narrower than expected. I usually wear a size 8 or sometimes 8.5, but these 8.5 are too tight. I ordered a M width and they are more like a narrow. I am going to try a larger size, but I also notice a seam along the top of the foot near the laces that rubs. I was trying to replace a pair of anti-gravity JP Get Going by easy spirit. But JCPenny discontinued. These are more attractive, but less comfortable.
I love these shoes.  I have so much trouble finding shoes that fit my 10 W feet.  These are not quite as long as some size 10s but are a perfect fit for me.  My orthotics fit in them and they are very light weight yet have a lot of stability and are more stylish than just plain walking shoes.
I have six pair of Easy Spirit Traveltime slip-on shoes, and they're comfortable, but I needed a lace-up sneaker. My size is 10WW -- but they don't make this in WW (why? I really don't get why a company committed to comfortable shoes would only make WW in some styles). So I tried the 10W in this one. This shoe is really cute. It looks stylish and cool like a skater shoe, and the black is a shiny black. Awesome for wearing without socks, and they looked better on my feet than I expected. width-wise, not bad, but the real problem here is the length. My toes hit the front of the shoe on both sides, which is of course, not acceptable for a shoe meant for walking. And guess what? They don't make a wide at all in size 11. Seriously? What is up with that? Come on, comfort shoe companies. If you want us to be comfortable, you have to give us the sizes that we need!
