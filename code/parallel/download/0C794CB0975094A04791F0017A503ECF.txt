Nike Kids Little Pico III (Infant/Toddler)
Cute shoes but really big. My son typically fits a 3, but he just got orthotics, so I thought I'd go a half size up to accommodate. These easily run a half size bigger as it is. When I measure these against his 3s, they are enormous! Cute though, and they work well (in wide) over his orthotics, so I'll just buy the 3s and save the 3 1/2s for later.
These are the best shoes I have been able to find for my toddler. They are nice and wide, and look great with all outfits. I have tossed them in the washer after tons of wear and they come out looking brand new. My son wears foot orthodics and they work great with those in one size up, as well. Great shoes!!

I love this shoe! It is extremely comfortable. Felt true to size.Looks great with anything!
