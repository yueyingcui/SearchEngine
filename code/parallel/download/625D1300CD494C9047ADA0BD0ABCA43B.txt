Keds Kids Charlotte (Toddler/Youth)
Super cute, very clean looking without all the chaotic designs that so many shoes come with and very comfortable. The shoes have a nice cushioning. Makes great walking shoes or everyday use shoes. I like that because they are predominantly white, they match just about everything. My daughter is generally wearing a size 3 right now, but I had to get a 3 1/2 to have enough growth room to last a school year.
