Hoka One One Stinson Evo
I rather not write a review if it means these shoes fly (Hoka) off the shelves and we have the problem as in the stores and other on-line sites in that they are sold out. These trail running shoes are simply marvelous for ultras - despite the appearance they are neutral and with only 4mm drop are much like a raised minimalist shoe. Obscenely light despite their clunky their appearance. I am coming back to ultras after some serious surgery last year and completed a tough race 2 weeks ago in northern CA and I could not have done it without these shoes for my hips & knees and overall reduced fatigue. I will be 50 this year. For me it felt like I was running like a kid again - time to fly! Only complaint - they need to make larger sizes - my husband's not alone in needing a size larger than they make. Also the because trail runners do need to go up even a half to full size due to downhills, etc. to have a choice of narrower midfoot would be helpful for women. Keeping a manatee sized toe box would be helpful but the Stinson is superior re this to any of the many other shoes I have worn over the years.
