Nike Kids T-Run 3 Alt (Infant/Toddler)
These shoes are great!  My son gets so many compliments and they go with everything. They run true to size and are great quality for the price. So pleased. 
This is my son's second pair of Nike 3 Alt sneakers. He and I both love how easily they are to get on/off and how nice they look. Bonus: the heel is a little high so when my son is wearing a pair of pants that are a bit too long, I choose these for his shoes to help keep the cuffs from dragging on the ground! Will definitely be getting the next size when he outgrows this pair.
Super cute boys shoes. My twins have these and we get so many compliments on them. The boys love to wear them so much I just bought them again in the next size up. Easy on and off, too.
Bought these for my four year old in 9.5. They are true to size. He loves them, he says he can run fast with them! Comfortable, durable and cute! Good job Nike.
Purchased these in size 10 for my four year old son. He loves the color green and these did not disappoint. The only problem that I have with them is that the top of the shoe is white, really white. It won;t stay that white for long!
