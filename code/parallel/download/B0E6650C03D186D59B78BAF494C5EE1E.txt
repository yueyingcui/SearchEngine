Sperry Kids Bluefish (Infant/Toddler)
Got this for my one year old who measures a size four. Should be in a four and a half, so a five should fit, right? Wrong. Got it in wide, too. Very snug even without socks. Should work for babies with skinny feet.
Adorable. My child definitely needed the wide. I think Sperry wides are more like regulars and their regular is more like narrow. Otherwise true to size. High quality shoe.
I purchased these shoes for my 2 year old. They look as great in person as they do on the website. They look like they are strong, durable and could be comfortable. My only complaint is the fact that the shoe is extremely narrow. I purchased a medium for my son and although they are his correct size the fact that the shoe is so narrow I couldn't get the shoe all the way on. I liked them so much I purchased the same size just in a wide and they fit the same exact way. There is no difference in the width between the medium and wide. I have went up a size to see if it works, hopefully it will or I will have to get boat shoes somewhere else.

I looked high and low for this shoe for my little girl. You don't know how excited I am that she will get this shoe. I danced after I order them. It's very comfortable and looks good with her jeans. Good to know that they come in children sizes.

Finally I found the size!!
We have tried finding this cool shoe for my little girl for 3 months now- I found your website and was very happy and now she will get them for Christmas-I promise it will be the gift that she is the most excited about- I just can't wait until after Christmas so I can buy my little boy a pair!!! Too cute!!!
