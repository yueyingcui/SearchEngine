adidas Originals Superstar 2 - Canvas
I have three pairs of the Adidas originals, all 9Â½ - but these shoes are just a touch small compared to the others - so I had to return and order half a size up. Based on all of our reviews, I guess these ones run a little small. But otherwise they are perfect! I love Adidas originals!
These definitely are smaller than the usual Superstars. I ordered two pair, and had to exchange one pair for a half size up. They simply felt shorter than usual. But the half size up was just fine. The shelltoe is the same rubber piece, but it's got a piece of canvas glued down on it. It's distinctive, and I wear them often. Same comfort as the other superstars. Give 'em a try.
