Nike Keystone 3/4
I've got two slightly different sized feet, so I have to order close to the larger size (9.5). The high heel-back rubbed way too much and after an hour I had a gnarly blister.
Otherwise, these were very comfortable. The quality seems about middle-of-the-road so I wouldn't expect to get more than a full season out of them. 
I ordered these shoes for my husband, who has wide feet. He wasn't sure the Nike shoes would be true to size. He has never found Nike shoes to be "wide foot" friendly. Unfortunately, he was right. Even I thought they did not look like a wide shoe when they came out of the box. Definitely not true to size for the wide width.
The Nike Keystone 3/4 are a great set of baseball cleats. They are very cheap so they are good for anybody. I bought them for my small interscholastic league. I bought all the colors and the red is the nicest. I am usually a size 11 and the 10 and 1/2's fit me the best. The shoes are reasonably comfortable and the style is lacking, but if you want a good set of cheap cleats these are the best bang for the buck ones out there.
