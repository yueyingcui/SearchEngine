New Balance MW927
I have searched for a shoe like this for years! It is the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned. I work retail construction and I am on the concrete for 12 hours a day. These shoes really support my arch and cushion my feet all day long. At the end of the day my feet are tired, as expected, but not in agonizing pain like before with other shoes. The price is high, but the comfort is well worth the expense. I found the size to be accurate. The quality seems to be good so far. I will be buying an extra pair or two to keep for future use.
These are the first New Balance shoes I've had that feel a size bigger than labeled.
