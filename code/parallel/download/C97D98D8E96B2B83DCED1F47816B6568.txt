SKECHERS Tone Ups - Run
These seemed narrower than other wide Skechers I've tried.  I got them because I've just started walking for exercise again and have been trying to find some good looking shoes that are also good walkers.  These are cool looking, no doubt, but they don't really fit me right and didn't have the kind of cushioning and support I need to be able to walk without a lot of pain afterward. Also, having had some of the Skechers Shape-ups in small men's sizes that worked well for me, I expected the sole on these Tone-ups to propel the foot forward a bit better.  Since I can't return them now, I'll probably try to find some insoles to make them suitable for casual wear.  The two pairs of shoes that have worked best out of the five I have tried (both other brands) are sadly also the ugliest, so I may have learned a lesson here.   
Cute sneakers, bright and sassy. I had to return them because the left shoe felt about 1/2 size too small and caused my foot to overpronate. Not sure what that was about.
Zumba ladies these are your shoes! I know they are categorized as running shoes but these are amazing for Zumba. The toe box is light and streamlined for pivots and they are cushioned enough for jumping. I wear an 8Â½ and had to buy an 8 so maybe go down half a size. Enjoy them!
Love these sneakers. They are true to size and I find them very light and comfortable. They didn't even need time to "break them in". I also love the color combination. I tried out 3 other brands/styles of shoes before deciding on this one. I highly recommend.
I just love them. They are so comfortable and give a nice little spring to your step. Nice and light not heavy. True to size. Looking to order another pair in a different color so I can keep one at work and one at home.
This pair of Skechers are awesome. The best part is that they are so light and comfortable. They are true to size also. And the colors are great.
