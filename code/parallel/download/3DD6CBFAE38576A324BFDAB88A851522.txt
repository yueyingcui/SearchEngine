Supra Vaider
My son loves these! We are a KState Wildcat Family and we love our purple. My son and everyone he sees just loves the shoes. He says they are the most comfortable shoes he's worn. Granted he is only 11 and a size mens 10!
These are the best skate shoe that I have had in a long time. They are super grippy. It is nice when you can trust shoes when skateboarding. They run true to size. I have narrow size 14 and most 14 sized shoes are catered to fat feet. These are great shoes.
Cool shoes. The size seems right but the laces were too short to lace them to the top. Bummer, had to return.
