Converse Kids Chuck Taylor&reg All Star&reg Easy Slip (Toddler/Youth)
My son loves these. They look cool. They are easy on/off. Only thing is top rubs on his ankle a bit so he should wear higher socks. He's had them on most every day since we bought and they go with all. I can't answer questions about sizing cause it's not my foot. I just had him measured and find he is a size larger than I ordered but hope these run bigger as salesperson told me so we break even.
These are the most convenient and comfortable high cut shoes for kids. I bought these for my 2 boys. I got 2 colors of each. I love the velcro on both sides and easy to put on and off every day. I think these are 1 size larger. I would definitely recommend these to moms with younger boys!
The shoes looks so cool. The Velcro back entry easy to use  to slip my feet!
I wear normally 5.5 youth. I ordered 4.5 youth in Converse size. It is a little bigger. I should have ordered a half size smaller. However, it is perfect to wear in winter because I wear a thick sweater shoe socks in cold weather. 
Very cute but wicked hard to put on my 4 year old son's foot.  He has a normal width foot, normal instep.  It is strange no one else has mentionned this problem.  I have to pull the velcro part way back and yank the tongue really hard so that he can even put his foot into the shoe.  After doing so, he has to jump up and down and wriggle something awful to get his heel in.  We had to buy a second pair of size 11 Chucks, this time with laces.  Those were fine to put on.  It is just these velcro ones that we have problems with.
I thought these would be really cute for my 3 year old and they are cute, but they are hard for him to get on because they are high tops. I am returning for a pair of Keens, which is a brand we love! Chucks will have to wait until he's a bit older! By the way, they do run a half to full size larger than other brands. The Converse slip on version in pink is a huge hit for my 8 year old!
