ASICS GT-2170™ GORE-TEX®
I am a pool guy, I bought these to work in. These are the best overall shoes I ever owned. Very comfortable and supportive. I need the Gore-Tex to keep my feet dry all year long. The size is about a half small . I usually do a 12.5 but needed 13. I will definitely buy Asics again! It was my first pair. I hurried and bought another identical pair before they were gone.
These run a half size small. I normally wear a 9.5 in all the Asics I've ever bought and this model in 9.5 was too tight!
