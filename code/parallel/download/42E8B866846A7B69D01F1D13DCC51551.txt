Nike Dual Fusion Run
I love this shoe! I usually buy Nikes; however, this has to be the most comfortable one yet! Fits snug but not tight and is true to size!
I like these - very pretty. I have narrow feet so they fit me well but I wouldn't recommend for anyone with wide feet. There is a removable insole with a weird little vertical arch that doesn't really go up under the arch for support. The insole isn't very cushiony but I ordered a half size larger than usual (always recommend for athletic shoes) and have room to add better insole with arch support if needed. I like that the tongue is tapered at the top. Good shoe for the money.
My son loves these shoes! He wears a size 16 and has flat feet so shoes aren't always easy to find and comfortable for him to wear. These are the best fitting and most comfortable he has had in several years. Thanks for your wide selection and sizes!
