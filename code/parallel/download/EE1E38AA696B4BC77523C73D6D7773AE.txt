Sperry Kids Boat Lug 3-Eye (Youth)
I have three sons and purchased a pair for each as part of their school uniform. All fit true to size, wore well and looked good. Dark brown doesn't easily show scuffs or dirt. (We used to be able to buy Bass tie bucks for kids and no other shoe held up as well. These don't look as dressy with the school uniform but do hold up to daily use by active boys.)
