Callaway Savoryâ„¢
I bought these more for the looks than for the mixed reviews (hoping the positive ones would be more like my experience). I took heed of them by wearing the shoes around the house and breaking them in for a couple of weeks before actually wearing them on the course. It worked! I didn't even think about my shoes or my feet during my play, which is how it should be! Also, I rec'd compliments from my pro on my stylish new shoes! I tend to run between sizes and so probably should have gone up in the length, but have a narrow foot so I wear my inserts and they are fine in that regard. Good luck!
