Five Ten Dragon
If I could only have one shoe for steep climbing this would be the one!  The Dragon has been my shoe of choice for years.  I was still using an old pair of the velcro version when these new updated lace-up came out.  This new Dragon is far superior to the old one, with a better heel and glove like fit.  The combination of the down turned toe and stealth rubber will help you pull with you feet like no other shoe can.  I wear my street shoe size and they are perfect.
Climbed for the last 16 years. 5.13b to V10. By far the best shoe Iâ€™ve ever used. Bought it sized the same as my street shoe (I wear a 7 in the Jet 7s and had to buy a 9 Dragon).
