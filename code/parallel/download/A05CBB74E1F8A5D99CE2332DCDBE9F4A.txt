New Balance MT1110
This is a great shoe, about 1/2 size small so size up.   There is little arch support, but added an orthotic and it kills!   Great for wider feet!
Got this shoe. Ran 1/2 small, so returned for 1/2 size larger. Other than that, it is a great shoe, excellent construction and quality. Firm support and great sole for moderate trail running/walking and comfort.
