Nike Action Mogan Mid 2 SE
I have a pair of these without the SE because I don't like how these look. And I love them (without the SE). They are extremely comfortable I actually prefer to run in these over running shoes, for P.E. I didn't have any problem on width because I have an extremely slender foot and the length in the bigger sizes run bigger I usually ware a 15 in Vans but I ware 14 in these. The only negative I have for these shoes is they can get a little hot in the summertime. Other than that I will continue purchasing Nike Mogan shoes until Nike stops selling these, wonderful shoes.
Great shoe when I first got is was to small but returned and got a bigger size had them for about 6 months and are in great conditioning I BMX!
