Love this shoe! I don't compete in tri's but I was going on vacation and needing a cute, comfy shoe that could take lots of walking and keep my feet cool. These shoes are made to be worn without socks - bonus! Comfy, cool, looked great (mine are pink). No "breaking in" time required. Slip on & off (no tying). Some say it runs 1/2 size small, but I like a good fit (especially without socks) so it was true to size for me. So comfy and convenient, I'll order a 2nd pair for when the first eventually wears out.
