Macbeth Gatsby
Love this shoe! Classy and fun - I wear it with semi-formals and casuals. Very comfortable and true to size. A quick note: My first pair of these shoes had an issue. The right side shoe's inner sole was bad...seemed to project upwards hurting my arch. Got it replaced and the new pair is fine.
Big Macbeth fan. The Gatsby shoe itself is very nice to look at, simple and smart looking. The size lengthwise to me fits true to size the width may be a bit narrow feeling but once you get your foot in them, still comfortable. There's a bit of padding inside around the toe makes it a bit tight but really comfortable again. My arches aren't too drastic but it was also one if the first things I noticed about the insole, they are made to support a medium to high arch. So people with low arches may want to replace the sole. If buying the leather model the bending point in the toe will crease so if that bothers you get the waxed canvas model. The only issue about these is that they split at the heel from the sponge sole making them very delicate to remove. Hopefully this gets reinforced and this shoe is one of the best Macbeth have right now.
I fell in love with the sneaker but dressy look of these the moment I saw them. I had a very difficult time tracking down my size, but finally did. They definitely fit my foot lengthwise but are a tad tight widthwise, but I have a fairly wide foot. I am not a fan of most vegan dress shoes, typically because they are rather expensive unless you get low quality shoes that happen to be vegan, so this is an excellent value for a stylish shoe, and Macbeth has made some quality vegan shoes over the years.
