Stride Rite Kayla Lace (Infant/Toddler)
I feel that these little sneakers are are perfect for an active toddler. They are incredibly light weight, they have flexible sole and they fit true to size. I have searched for lace up sneakers since my daughter was one with no success. A year later and I finally found what I was Looking for. They are not clunky and look adorable with just about anything!
