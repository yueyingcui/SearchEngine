Superga 2750 LAMEW
I bought these in silver, and while I love how they look, they aren't very comfortable. Initially I ordered a 1( US size 9.5) which was way too large so I got the size smaller. they fit, but I will say they rub the back of my heel and my pinkie toe. They aren't very supportive either. So now I only wear them if I don't plan on walking a lot.
I bought two of the gold pair -- I wasn't sure which size would fit. It turns out that the five fit just right and I plan to return to larger pair. (Buy a smaller size than you usually wear.) These shoes are fun! They are comfortable and everyone notices them. I was hoping to get a red pair, guess. I waited too late in the season. Note: I'm not a sneaker gal but I feel at home wearing these.
These shoes are so so so so lovely! I have wanted a pair of Supergas for ages and finally ordered these in the orchid color which is absolutely beautiful. I am always a 38 in EU size (7½ US), but I found these to be just a little bit bigger than I needed. I can still wear them though, but have to keep the laces quite tight. I think I would be comfortable in a 37½, too. Regardless, these are great shoes, great style and look, and really comfortable. And I cannot get over the beautiful sparkly purple color!
