Speedo Womens Hydro Comfort
The shoe fits good, it's a half size larger than what I wear. It slips on easily even with my high arches. Not as bouncy as the Ryka shoe but nice and light. A good buy.
This shoe is perfect for my aquatic aerobics class. I have wide feet and it fits just fine. I did order it up a half size, based on the recommendation of the ladies in my class--better bigger than smaller. 
Bought these shoes for a trip to Belize. First time I wore them was a four hour hike through rain forest and caves. Felt great. Hiked well. Swam well. Absolutely no problems. And they look cute too. I bought a size 8 as I usually wear a 7.5 and have a somewhat wide foot. I was concerned they might be a smidge too roomy but that definitely was not the case (and obviously I didn't wear socks).
