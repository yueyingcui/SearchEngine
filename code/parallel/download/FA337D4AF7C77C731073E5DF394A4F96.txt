Puma Kids Attencio I FG Jr (Toddler/Youth)
Purchased item for my daughter and found we needed a full size larger. Shoe was still a bit snug on the sides but not uncomfortable. Soft sides and some flexibility made it a nice cleat.
My son is 6 1/2 years old and loves these cleats.  They were true to size and lightweight.
