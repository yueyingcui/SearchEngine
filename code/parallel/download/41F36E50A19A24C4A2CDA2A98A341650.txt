Keen Utility PTC Mary Jane II
I like the looks of this shoe, but I have narrow heels; and the heel of this shoe is so heavy. Even with the strap, the heel slid off my foot at every step. The front of my foot is wide, and that part of the shoe was very comfortable (no biting at the edges). But I think if I got the next smaller size, to keep the heel on, the front would be too narrow and would bite in at the front.
