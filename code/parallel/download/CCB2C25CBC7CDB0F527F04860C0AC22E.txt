PUMA Drift Cat 4
Great looking shoe, however, it runs 1/2 to a full size small and is narrow.
Ordered these shoes for my exact size, although some reviews said they were smaller than normal. All I can say is, they fit perfectly and are very nice to wear and give great comfort.
I purchased these for my husband, who has bought dozens of pumas and has three pairs right now. All of those are size 10½, but for some reason the 10½ in the Drift Cat 4 was a bit small. He even has narrow feet, which makes it even more odd that we had to order up half a size. Otherwise, the shoes are great. They are a little dressy, so you can wear them for casual Friday at work but they still are good for T-shirt and jeans as well.
I liked the look of the shoe online and ordered a size 14.  When I tried on the shoe it appeared to be a size 12 or so, therefore it is going back.
