Vans Kids Rowley SPV (Toddler/Youth)
My 10-year-old loves these shoes. They did run a bit large compared to his usual Nikes, and we ended up having to exchange for a smaller size than his usual. I didn't notice when I ordered them, but the top of the shoe is made of suede, not canvas like the back. After only a month of wear, the suede is starting to fade and look a bit worn, while the canvas still looks brand new. We'd order Vans again, but we'd probably go with an all canvas version next time.
