New Balance Kids YF447 (Youth)
After trying on every pair of cleats in a nearby soccer store, my 8 year old was nearly reduced to tears because every shoe pinched his feet and were unwearable. We decided to look online and found these cleats available in wide sizes. He wears them for football and they are comfortable and he feels faster. 
These are the perfect shoes for those who have tried to fit into other brands but are too narrow or in between sizes.
