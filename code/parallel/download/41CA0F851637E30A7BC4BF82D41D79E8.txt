Nike Nike5 Elastico Finale
Stylish. Sleek. Show stopper. Yet, very narrow at base of tongue. Makes for a very uncomfortable day trip. Thought to return them for the size up (12.5). However, I think because of the length...the indented area at the bottom of the laces may show more prominent and take away from the style. So I endure with half day use and hope to break them in and the leather stretches a bit.
