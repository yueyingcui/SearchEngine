New Balance MO20
I really enjoyed the shoe...light weight, stylish, but it just wasn't wide enough. Usually if I order a half a size bigger for my foot, the shoe becomes wide enough...but not this one.
Very neat shoe. Comfortable and true to size...unfortunately, quite a poor description to use the word "waterproof" anywhere near the description. NB uses the same descriptor on their site - but, alas, these are NOT WATERPROOF in any fashion. Don't make the mistake I made. Go for something labeled as having Goretex as I should have done initially. Neat shoe - NOT waterproof. Did I mention these are not waterproof?
