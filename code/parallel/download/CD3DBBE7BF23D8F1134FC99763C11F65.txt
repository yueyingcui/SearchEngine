Nike Air Ring Leader Low
It looks exactly as it appeared: good style and true to size and width.  Though a bit lacking in sole softness thus earned it an only 3 stars for comfort. Great style made it up, so bumped up overall score to a 4.
I got these shoes the other day and they are nice shoes for just going out with shorts and jeans. Have not been to the gym with them yet but feel is great and true to size so don't go smaller or larger.
