O'Neill Superfreak Tropical ST Boot
Very nice for water sports. One thing for sure, they are small to size. Order one full size up. I'm a nine and real tight. Size 10 are perfect.
Great fit! Very light weight. For women, go a size or two smaller than what you wear in women's sizes and these will fit well. My only wish is that they made a style more appealing for women. 
My size is a 9 1/2 and the website said to go small -- wrong, I needed the 10.
Great reef boots. Very durable. Wife and I used ours surfing the reefs around Bali and also while riding the moped. Still in great shape after 2 weeks of tough use. Fit is true to size.
The O'Neil SuperFreak boots are very comfortable and seem to be wearing well. A lot of web-based comments suggested that these boots ran big and suggested that you order a size down. I found the sizing to be accurate as labeled.
I wear 8.5 and following description/suggestion on the sizes I ordered size 8 which were small and tight on my feet. I returned these and ordered size 9 which seem a nice fit. They're a little spacious on the toes but much nicer fit than 8 were which would have ached my feet if I were to wear them for extended period of time. I needed water shoes to wear on the shorelines of the beach and because of my fear of crab bites. They seem stylish and nicely designed. I cannot comment on durability though.
I read that these run large and you should order a half size down form normal. I wear an 8.5 so I ordered the 8. Too small and too tight. I ordered the 9 and hope that fits better. Otherwise, I love the feel and the sole seems like it will be great for walking on sandy, rocky paths.
