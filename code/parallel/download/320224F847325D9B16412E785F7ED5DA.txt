Supra The Wrap
Supra The Wrap is an excellent shoe. It looks great, feels great, and its light weight makes it very comfortable. I took the advice of the other reviews and order one size larger than I normally would and it fits perfectly. If you need a comfy, inexpensive street shoe, this is the one.
Ran a size small, couldn't get them on comfortably.  Would get them a size up, but they are out of stock in the color I wanted.
Great looking shoes, but the sizes run very small. Order one size larger.
