PUMA G. Vilas L2
My older son recommended me to this site after I could not find a decent size 14 sneaker for my youngest son. I was pleasantly surprised to find a nice looking sneaker, inexpensive and delivered the very next day. I will also be recommending this site as well as ordering for myself in the future.
This is a great shoe usually - have always wore Puma's. Not as pleased with this purchased - the fit is a little tight. Wished I would have bought a 1/2 size larger.
I wear a size 9.5/10 in women and I have wide flat feet. I got these in a 9.5 and they were unbelievably narrow. Even if I went a size up they'd be way too small. The top of the shoe was very tight on my foot.
Great classic shoe, and can't go wrong. Styling is once again relevant almost 30 years later! This is my 3rd pair of Pumas. All pumas sizes are consistent and the build quality is awesome.
