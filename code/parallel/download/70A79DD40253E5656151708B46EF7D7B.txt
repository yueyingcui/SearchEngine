Sanuk Standard
My 22 year old son wishes to have these in every color. I tried them on and they are so spongy and comfy! They run big; get a size smaller.
Super comfortable slip ons.  Perfect for informal events and lazy days. I had to order a half size smaller than usual. 
Hey guys, I work at a surf store that sells several different kinds of Sanuks, and I'd just like to say that Sanuks, along with most shoes (or closed toe sandals) WILL stretch out the more times you use them. I am a size 10.5, and I bought a size 10 which of course felt a bit snug for a few days, but after a week and a half they fit perfectly. I bought my Sanuks 2 years ago and still have them to this day.  
Cool shoes. Caution, this shoe is not a sandal. They start smelling after a few weeks wearing them without socks. Another thing, got a blister on the heel after walking a long distance (2 miles) in them. Good thing is they are true to size.
You won't be disappointed. Very forgiving for all types of feet. Mine are flat size 13 and it is very difficult to find anything that fits properly.
Great shoes, perfect for summer, but they run large and don't have half sizes, so they can tend to slip off in the back...
Awesome shoes, definitely recommend going a half size smaller if you're usually between sizes. I bounce between 10 and 10.5 with most brands, the 10 fits great.
The shoes were for my 18 year old son. He tried them on and never took them off. In fact, as we speak, he is in Spain on a school trip with his Sanuks. He has been walking in them all day for nine days and said they are very comfortable. They are true to size, easy to get in and out of and apparently a good walking shoe too.
These are more comfortable than Vans, but since these are meant to be worn without socks, you will have to wash them a few times; other than that, they're great shoes. If you plan to wear them with socks, go half a size up.
