Puma Kids Tune Cat B Jr (Toddler/Youth)
Love these shoes! My 6 year old picked them out. I was nervous about the white, but cleans easy and haven't had any concerns with that. Like that the soles have the size in them, so you know how they fit your child's foot. 

I love these shoes and so does my son! My younger son has already had 2 pairs (infant/toddler). The white doesn't get dingy like other white shoes do, a big plus to looking nice! I do feel they run a size small. I will be buying these again for the next school year!
