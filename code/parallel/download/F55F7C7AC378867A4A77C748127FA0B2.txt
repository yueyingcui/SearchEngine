Keds Champion Chukka Canvas
Beautiful pair of shoes especially in the Grey. Few things to consider though: these are very narrow throughout and long in the toe (size 10). I guess for that reason it felt and looked awkward on my feet, but I could see these looking great on someone else. They are really clean and classic.
This shoe is great! I think they look a lot better on your feet then in the photos, and there surprisingly lots more supportive then I had planned. They size I bit large but over all this is an awesome shoe!
This is a nice durable lightweight canvas shoe with an insole. Most canvas shoes I buy come with a sealed insole that never have any arch support. This shoe remarkably, has arch support and after my first day of wearing them all day and walking a lot, I had no bruises or blisters whatsoever. The chukka style makes this shoe look great and with the insole, a great summer shoe for sure. Shoe sizes seems to replicate Vans canvas originals. I had to order a half size smaller and still have plenty of room.
