Stride Rite Web-Slinger (Youth)
My 5-year-old son had the blue and red version of these and they were really the only pair of shoes he would wear.  He completely wore them out!  They are made well and easy to put on, so when it came time to buy another pair of shoes, he decided on the same ones, just the other colorway.  Since he is growing, I ordered a half  size up.  The problem with this is the velcro strap will not attach tight enough for him with the little extra room.  He pulls and pulls and it goes so far across that the velcro does not meet and stay tight.  I will have to get him another pair of shoes to wear until these fit a little better.  So my recommendation would be to order them true to size.
My little guy loves them! He has a wide foot and these fit him wonderfully, as I ordered them in XW. No struggle to get them on at all. I couldn't be more pleased with them. Expensive but worth it, and I will order them again in his next size.
