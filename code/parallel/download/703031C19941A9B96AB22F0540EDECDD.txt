Sebago Seashore Two-Eye
These boat shoes are very comfortable and trendy. True to size and width. Arch support is fair. One thing I like about Sebagos is that you don't have to order up or down as the sizing is on point. I receive a lot of compliments when I wear my Sebagos and you will too so buy with confidence.
Adorable Sebago Plaid knock-abouts for the summer. Feels comfortable too. I ordered my typical size. No problems. Haven't walked in it yet, for longer than half-hour so I don't know about the arch support. As with any new shoe, I wouldn't wear it all day until it was properly 'broken in.'
