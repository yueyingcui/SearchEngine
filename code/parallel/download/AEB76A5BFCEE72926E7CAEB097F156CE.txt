Vivobarefoot Off-Road Hi
I have been looking for this shoe for years, so far fantastic (though I have not done any serious hiking in it yet). I found this shoe to be comfortable right out the box, and it is getting even better as it breaks in. I have a tall foot and many shoes are a bit narrow for me, however this fits perfectly (especially in the toe box). I bought a half size over my nominal and this fits perfectly with standard socks. After breaking in I think I should have no problem wearing thick socks. This should should be primarily thought of a hiking boot as opposed to a barefoot shoe. As hiking boots go it is much more natural than any I have tried before. There is no arch support (which is the point of course), and the sole is quite thin and flexible. The ball of my foot feels nearly (but not completely) unpadded, while the heal has a bit of impact padding. On a long hike, especially if there are sharp rocks, I will expect my feet to get tired (this is what I was looking for). Ankle support is moderate to high. The tread pattern looks like it will provide excellent traction, though there is no heal (I have not really tested this out yet). The construction seems really solid, though only time will tell.
