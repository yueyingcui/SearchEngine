Nike Air Max Correlate
Love! They are true to size and so comfortable. Thinking I want to get another pair!
I bought these, a pair of Asics and a pair of Sauconys. This is the only pair I kept. While the Sauconys were slightly more comfortable, these are much more stylish. I ordered a half size bigger as I normally do in Nikes, and they have a little room at the toe, made me wonder if I needed to order a half size bigger, but my regular size may have been too small, hard to know. Overall, loving the shoe.
