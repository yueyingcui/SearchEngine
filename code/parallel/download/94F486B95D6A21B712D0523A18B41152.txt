Puma Kids Drift Cat III L Diamond Fade V (Infant/Toddler/Youth)
We bought these shoes for my daughter hoping she could wear them right away. I'm not much for returns, so since they are way too big (we even ordered a full size smaller than the chart suggested), we'll hold onto them until they fit. My only concern is that they are so wide that they may never fit her skinny feet.
I was looking for a simple, white athletic shoe for my 3 year old and this one was on sale. I'm usually more practical and never thought I'd buy a Puma brand, but these worked out great and my daughter loves them. So great, in fact, that I went ahead and ordered another pair in a larger size so she can wear them for years.
My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves these sneakers. They are super cute. a little flash without being too cheesy. My daughter also loves animals, so the fact that there are 3 pumas on her sneakers is the best! They appear to be comfortable so far (she's only been wearing them for 2 weeks) and no breaking in needed. She had been wearing a size 7, but based on the Puma size chart we ordered a size 8 and they fit great. We had even ordered a size 9 based on other reviews, but they were way too big. She was tripping over her feet. But since they are so cute, we decided to keep them for when her feet grow into the next size!
Love these shoes for my 1 1/2 year old daughter! She always wants to wear her kitty shoes. They fit true to size and are very cute! I actually had them in a size smaller and will be buying them again when she grows out of this size!
So cute! Wish they had them in my size. Very comfortable, but they run a full size, to size and a half small. Order them bigger than your child would normally wear. My 2 1/2 year old wears a 7-7 1/2 in Vans, and we had to order these in a 9.
My daughter is only 2 but she loves the style and comfort of these sneakers. It's all she wants to wear. They are true to size.
