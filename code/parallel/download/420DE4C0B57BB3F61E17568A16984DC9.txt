Jambu Sport Sider Barefoot
Unfortunately I had to return these shoes because there was barely 1/4 inch in front of my big toes, therefore, when I walked they felt too tight. They are a sporty looking pair of shoes that would have been perfect for my vacation. I wear an 11 so can't get a 1/2 size larger, but would recommend that. 
Great feeling shoe which lets the breeze through, but has good support from the sole and above. Wanted it for hot weather here, but the high heel top rubbed a blister on the back of my foot. Don't know if larger size would have helped-was a litle tight all over at size 7. Bought on 6PM sale.
Love the "different" look of this shoe and really wanted them to fit. They run pretty true to size but maybe run very slightly on the smaller size -- probably not enough to order up a size, though. My problem with them was the width. I wear an 11 and have relatively narrow feet, so these were a tad too wide for me to comfortably wear. Too bad. It's definitely a comfy shoe if it fits well.
These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned! I have them in blue as well. I wish they'd come out in black! Love how light they are and just enough support. I wear a 5 1/2 but they only started at size 6 so they are just a little loose, nothing a thin sock cant fix but I wear them with and without. Extremely comfortable!
These are super light but will stay on your feet when wading in them.  Fit very nicely and I like that they let me wiggle my toes.  When I say true to size, that is with bare feet.  Not designed for wearing with socks, though you certainly could.
I love these shoes! They fit perfectly (no breaking in) and are so comfortable. It feels like one is walking barefoot. I'm wearing them in the house as an all day shoe.I'm going to buy another pair for outdoors, for when I want an enclosed shoe, but something really light for the hot, summer weather. I'm a size 6 and they fit perfectly.
