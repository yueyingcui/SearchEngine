SKECHERS Energy - Afterburn
Great shoe but at least a size too small. I need to send these back because there was not a larger size available.
Great Shoe - 
Just got this pair in and they feel great. I had bought a pair of New Balance MW626 - Nubuck . These were not even close to the right size. If your looking for a wide width this one is on the money. 

5th Pair - 
I always have a new & an old pair at all times, Wonderful shoes that fit me well.I have wide feet and it is hard to buy good shoes in my size.

Great Shoe -
I brought these for my boyfriends 40th Birthday he really did like them although they were a little off on size by 1/2 size. I have returned them and will be receiving the larger size. He really did like the style and the rugged sole. He also like the support even though they were not his true size. Thanks for your swiftness in delivery I ordered on a Tues night and had the sneaks in my hand that Friday afternoon. Great Job keep up the good work.

Goodbye foot problems -
This shoe was the answer to my endless search for a shoe that fit me true to advertised sizes and widths. Comfortable and a real pleasure to wear.
