Jumping Jacks Kids Pal (Toddler/Youth)
Appear to be well made...Look adorable and seem very versatile but please note: The size in inches is the ACTUAL shoe length NOT to fit that length foot! I ordered these along with a pair of KEEN shoes and the KEEN's were nearly 2 inches longer! (I am not exaggerating!) I am now exchanging for shoe 2 sizes larger than I previously ordered and wanted to mention as not to have this happen to another consumer
This shoe runs big! My son wears a size 9, so I ordered the 8.5-9 size of this particular shoe. It was huge. They are nice looking shoes but they are way too big.
My son wears a size 1. I ordered the size 1-1.5 and these shoes are way too big. I love the shoe but returning for a smaller size. He will be in the 3rd grade by the time he grows into these if I keep. So we are not.
