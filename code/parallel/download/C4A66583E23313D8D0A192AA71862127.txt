Nike Kids Super Bad Shark BG (Toddler/Youth)
I read the reviews before I ordered and saw that they ran a size smaller. So I ordered a size bigger and they fit perfectly.
I bought these for my 11 year old son and he could not get his foot into the top. The top is slanted really narrow and he could not squish his foot into them. Not sure if a 1/2 size larger would have helped. He really liked the silver top.
These shoes were very narrow. My son wears a size 10 and I couldn't even get these size 10 cleats on his feet.
