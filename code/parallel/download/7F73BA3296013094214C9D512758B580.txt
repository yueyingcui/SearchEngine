PUMA GV Special
Perfect for flat feet! I have worn custom orthopedics in my shoes for years and have severely flat feet that causes pain constantly. I just got back from 3 weeks in France including 8 days of sightseeing in Paris. I heeded the warnings and got a full size larger than I normally would, and I'm glad I listened. Even at a size bigger, my orthotics don't fit in these shoes, so I tried them by themselves. Amazing! The oversized cushion sole is breathtaking and I was able to walk 6 miles per day the whole time I was there with no ill effects. I now own 2 pairs. Only con: They used a cheap paint to make the sole cushion white and the paint separates and flakes off almost instantly. I plan to write to Puma about this.
Like the shoe - I bought them for work in a restaurant and comfortable to walk around in all night. Glad I took the advice of others to go up a 1/2 size - otherwise they would have been too snug.
Very comfortable and not too heavy for leather. Like all puma products I have to go up a full size from 7.5 to 8.5 but no problem if you are aware.
These shoes fit true to size, are really comfy (great arch for my flat feet!), and look so cute with skinny jeans and shorts. I bought them in red and always get compliments when I wear them!
I own about 8 pairs of Pumas right now all size 13 and none of them are this narrow. I thought that I might break them in but they're so tight it's terrible.
