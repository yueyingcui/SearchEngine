Sanuk Sumo
4th pair of Sanuks, they are stiff at first and the heel counter angles in. They were a bear to put on the first two or three times. Felt a size small at first. Three days in they are great! No issues. Stretched out and broke in fast. Best pair so far!
Tese are my favorite shoes and I love the look and comfort of them but I cannot recommend them for anyone else to buy them. Te size is 1 size small but they will break in after about 2 weeks but during that time they are very cruel shoes. If you do order them get a tube of shoe goo handy. The complete sole separated on the left shoe after about 2 days. The bottom layer of the right shoe 2 days later, and then the same thing on the left 2 weeks later. Probably sound like an idiot but I would go through that again for these shoes.
I love Sanuk shoes, so I figured I'd try these out. Don't waste the money. They cut into your heal and are miserable on your feet. I got a size and a half larger to avoid the problem, and they still are uncomfortable.
