Brooks Kids PureFlow (Toddler/Youth)
These shoes are amazing! I got them for running and I just love them. They have amazing support and there size/width runs perfectly. Get these shoes!
These are the best child's running shoes that I have seen. My daughter, seven years old, who has always ran in Reebok Zigs, noticed the difference in her first 1600m. They are lighter, more comfortable and way more stylish. Brooks really hit a homerun with these shoes. Order the shoes half a size larger than what your child's feet measure at the shoe store (my daughter's feet measured a 13Â½ but we found that a 14 was what fit her.) As of right now, this will be the only shoes that I will ever purchase for her. I will just keep ordering the next size up. We will have to wait to see how the shoes hold up, but by looking at the construction I am sure that she will grow out of these shoes before they wear out. Buy these shoes!
