Caterpillar Movement
This shoe almost hits a sweet spot between business styled and everyday walking footwear, an area which few products are available from today's shoe manufacturers. Most shoes either very dressy and very uncomfortable or very comfortable while very casual. This shoe is rugged and padded enough that I would not hesitate to use it as my daily wear shoe. At the same time the subtle colors and leather styling makes it appropriate for most business casual environments. One warning: Sizes seem a bit off with this shoe. The size 11 was cavernous on my foot, it seemed to fit like a size 12. The size 10.5 is completely snug, a perfect fit. So you may have to return a pair or two until you find your size.
