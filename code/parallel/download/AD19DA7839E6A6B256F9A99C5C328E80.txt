Converse Kids Chuck Taylor® All Star® Street Cab Mid (Toddler/Youth)
Great pair of converse. Purchased for my 9 year old son. I like the padded style mid top and he loves the color. They run about a size too big so adjust accordingly. Also putting an extra padding to provide arch support may be necessary.
I bought these for my son and he likes the style. They come higher on the ankle than the lower cut Converses so they will be more comfortable in cooler weather. They are also at least a high size larger than his low cut Converses. There is a thick piece of elastic that holds the tongue to the shoe to go for the untied look.
