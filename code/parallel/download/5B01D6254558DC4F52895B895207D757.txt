Patagonia Manawa
Very comfortable shoes - minimalist construction, where the insole offers all of the support. Roomy toebox - probably not good if you have narrow feet, but since I have wide feet they're great! Look nice enough for "business casual" attire. Would recommend using shoe trees, as the leather is very supple and seems like it would shrink and deform if you don't use shoe trees. They seem to run a little big, too. I wear a size 11.5 in Patagonia running shoes but I wear a 10.5 in these and other "honeycomb" outsole Patagonia shoes.
