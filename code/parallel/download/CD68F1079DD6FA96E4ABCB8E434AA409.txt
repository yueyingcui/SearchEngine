Nike Golf Lunar Links
I tried this brand because it has size 10 1/2 but found it to stiff for my feet. Also I probably would wear an 11 in this brand. I usually wear Foot Joy which has a more flexible sole.
These felt a little large and so I wound up going with the Asics GEL Linkmasters.  The shoes were super white, and although I'm sure that would change it was a bit too much for me.  Also the sizing ran large, a half to full size.

I did like these though, and if the size a closer fit I might have chosen these over the asics.
