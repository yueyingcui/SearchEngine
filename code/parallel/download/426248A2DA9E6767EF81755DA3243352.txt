Nike Action Kids Mogan 2 Jr (Toddler/Youth)
Love these shoes! However, they do seem to run smaller than other Nike's. I had to order a half size up for my son.
These sneakers are great. My son loves them. True to size and very comfortable. 
My son loves these shoes. And he got thumbs up from the other boys in his school - always a good thing. They fit true to size.
