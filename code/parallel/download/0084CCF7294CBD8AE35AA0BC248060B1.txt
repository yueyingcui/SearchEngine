Dr. Martens Sylvie 3-Eye Shoe
Comfortable after breaking in.  The leather is quite stiff and shiny so the heels rubbed for the first few wears. These are fashion Doc Martens so you're not going to get the airware soles or the durability of conventional DMs. Wore them for walking on a vacation with and without socks and they were quite comfy.  I'm a size 5 and these were a little loose.  Simple in style with a retro look.   
The best shoes I have ever owned. Super comfortable and stylish. I wear a 10 US and got a 7 UK because their sizes run a tad large.
