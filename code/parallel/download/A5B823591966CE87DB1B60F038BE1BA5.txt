Bass Burlington
Comfortable, well made saddle shoe that runs true to size...my Mother always said, "You can always trust a man that wears Saddle Shoes."
These are good shoes for the price. They have a great classic look that does not go out of style. They really do fit true to size, just like my more casual shoes.
Love 'em! Stylish, comfortable & true to size. Great price, too!
These seem to run huge! I am sending these back and getting a full size smaller because there is at least an extra inch of extra room. They are pretty stiff in the heel and toe box too, but hopefully they will break in when I find the right size.
I ordered these as a surprise for my husband and he just loved them! As with all Bass shoes, great quality overall, but perhaps not as durable as your typical Bass shoe...just seem kind of lightweight. Definitely run large, we had to order a half size down to get a great fit.
Nice shoes, true to size, but very stiff leather. They took a long time to break in.
These shoes are great. They look very stylish and are comfortable. I ordered a size 12 and they felt a half size to a full size too big. I would recommend going at least a half size lower than what you usually wear. 
This is a good looking and well-made shoe.  The leather is rather stout and takes some time to become broken in, but it\'s not uncomfortable.  Typical of the quality construction of all Bass shoes I\'ve purchased.  Size seems to run a tiny bit large - my size 10 is a little roomier than the usual size 10s I wear in other shoes, but not so much that I\'d want to back down to a 9.5.
Nice shoe. Runs BIG. Size down perhaps half a size.

This shoe fits very true to size and is amazing in style and comfort. Great purchase. A classic!
