Keen Kids Ambler (Infant/Toddler)
We loved these! I bought Keens for our 18 month old as we were told to invest in good shoes. We were very satisfied with the fit and the quality. The shoes wear very well. I prefer the pink/grey color as opposed to the new wild orchid (we just ordered the next size up for fall). Highly recommend. 
We were so excited when we got them, but we could not get them on my 15 month old daughter's feet without a struggle. We ordered a size 4 which is her size but she has wide feet and we could not get them to slide easily on. Once we finally got the, on, we let her walk around in them and they sounded really heavy. We took them off a few minutes later and she had an imprint on the top of her foot from the shoe. It was obviously too tight because her feet are wide. That was a bummer, as we really liked the shoes but they do not make them in wide. On a good note, we bought a pair of 4W stride rite shoes and they slipped on and fit perfectly! If your toddler has wide feet, I recommend going up a size or trying another brand in a wide.
