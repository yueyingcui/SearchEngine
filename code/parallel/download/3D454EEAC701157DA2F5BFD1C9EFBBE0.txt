Teva Kids Raith Waterproof (Toddler/Youth)
We just bought size 6, because my son grew out of the size 5, and these were on sale. He loves them. He chose these for their style. They really are waterproof, and the ones he grew out of still perfectly good, even though he's typical active 8-year-old guy. Gave old ones to a pal with smaller feet.
My son loves these shoes right out of the box. They do run 1/2 to 1 size small so when ordering order up a whole size. My son normally wears a 1 and I ordered a 2 which worked well.
