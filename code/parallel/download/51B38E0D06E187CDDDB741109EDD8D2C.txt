Saucony ProGridâ„¢ Echelon LE
I really enjoy these shoes. I bought them 1/2 size bigger and they are extremely comfortable and light. I was very pleased with this purchase. Delivery was also faster than I expected.
The Saucony ProGrid Echelons I received were too small, and obviously were incorrectly sized.  

They are supposedly American size 12, but the corresponding English and European sizes listed on the shoes are much smaller than they would be if the shoes were truly size 12.

My old Saucony Grid Omni Walkers, which fit fine, are also American size 12, but English size 11 and European size 46.5.  

The new Saucony ProGrid Echelons are also nominally American size 12, but only English size 10 (compared to 11 for the older shoes) and European size 44.5 (compared to 46.5 for the older shoes).


I was disappointed. I am usually a size 12 and "normal" width. They are about half to full size smaller than stated and feel like a narrow width. They are going back...sad!
These are really roomy in the toe. I returned a New Balance, same size, because they were too small. Can't say these are a half size larger. But plenty of room for an orthotic. They look big, but that may be because I chose all white.
True to size. Very comfortable. The show is a little heavier than some others, but it will wear well like all my leather Saucony walkers.
