adidas Originals Campus 2
Great shoes. The selection of shoes in a size 15 seems to get smaller lately, with basketball shoes being most available. I really like this pair and the size was right. I have a narrow foot.
Awesome, stylish, and comfortable shoe. These shoes run true to size. I am a true 10.5 in women's and I ordered these in a 10.5 in womens. They fit great and look awesome for the summer. Loving the bright blue color! For someone with flat feet, and slightly wider than average feet, these work well with my orthotics and are wide enough.
Beautiful Cardinal color. A suggestion is get a suede spray for the shoe to protect it. Because this color will bleed on white sole without it. Also order a half size bigger than what your used to. Amazing customer service.
