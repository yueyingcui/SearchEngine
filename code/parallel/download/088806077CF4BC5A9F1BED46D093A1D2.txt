Privo by Clarks Macchiato
I am not a shoe person and have never spent so much on a pair of shoes, but I bought these based upon positive reviews of Privo by Clark shoes. I bought them hoping they would be comfortable for a lot of walking on an upcoming vacation. I am sad to say that I am disappointed. I think the shoes are adorable and they actually make my feet look cute and small. I ordered my usual size and, out of the box, they fit perfectly and seemed comfortable upon a cursory walk through my apartment to test them (which is why I did not return them). Learning from past (painful) experience to test new shoes before bringing them on vacation, I have been wearing the shoes on errands for the past few weeks and they are not all that comfortable. The top rear of the shoe hits in that tender spot at the back of the foot/ankle, enough to cause bleeding (so then I really could not return them!). This has lessened the more that I have worn the shoes, but it still does not hit comfortably. The bigger problem is that I notice my feet are tired after I have worn these shoes, even if I am not doing a great deal of walking, and I have not noticed that with other shoes that I have. I wore them around the office the other day, mostly sitting, and my feet were tired at the end of the day! As far as cushioning, it s not terrible, but I was expecting more for so much money. I can feel the sidewalks cracks, etc. when I walk. The shoes are very cute, so I am hoping I am still in the breaking in period and that they will become more comfortable in time, but simply for the lack of cushioning, I cannot imagine walking around a great deal with these.
