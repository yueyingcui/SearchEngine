Brooks Racer ST 5
I love these shoes! I am an avid runner 30 to 40 miles a week. They are light and very supportive shoes. I have been threw alot of shoes and these are the best I have had. I am buying more again which I never do. So if you are thinking about it, do it as it is well worth it and very affordable for the qualities of the shoe. By the size is the same as any others I have bought. Happy running
Lightweight and very comfortable. This is a great shoe for warm/hot weather. Order a half size larger than you do for dress shoes. If you don't like bright, don't go with this one.
These sneakers are great!  But I read online they run big and to order a half size too small.  They don't and I had to return them!  Order your normal size.
