The North Face Women's Ultra 50
Considering this for a non-rainy day walker.  Seems very breathable due to the mesh sides.  Wish it was GTX.  Comparing it to Merrell MOAB Ventilator sz 10,Skechers Interval sz 9.5 and 10 for final decision.  Only real neg is Brown/Citronelle Green color.  Would not prefer this combo at all but came in size.
Great fit, good ride and adequate protection for rocky trail runs. The lace up system is designed like any other, but this shoe envelopes the foot for a secure feel. Be sure to cinch the laces from the toes up for a custom-feel fit. Runs true to size. The notched laces are no amenity; the laces loosen like any other, so double-tie or come undone. Altogether, a dandy shoe that adheres to my mantra - run dirty, be happy.
