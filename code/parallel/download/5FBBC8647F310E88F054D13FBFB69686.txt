Diadora Kids Forza MD Jr (Toddler/Youth)
This brand runs runs at least 1-1.5 sizes smaller than Saucony.  My daughter is starting to grow out of a size 8 Saucony and her toes were right at the end of the size 9 Diadora Kids Forza shoe.
This Diadora style was a complete disappointment. The fit was about two sizes too small and very narrow.  The 4.5 has the appearance and fit of a 2.5.  I've never been this off ordering a shoe online.  The Adidas cleats are winners.
Great soccer shoe...not too expensive, fits well, and my son loved the wild colors :). We went a half size up because of the thick socks they wear and it worked perfectly!
In comparison with Puma and Nike of similar price, which were tried and returned, I found these shoes to be a bit wider overall with more room in the ankle. This was important for my 5-year-old daughter, considering the bulky socks and her stirrup-style shin guards. We also did order one size larger than her typical shoe size because of the socks and shin guards. I would recommend ordering a half-size or size up, depending on shin guard style. Straight out of the box, the sole was more flexible than comparison soccer shoes, leading to more comfort. So far the fold-over tongue has helped keep shoes from coming unlaced. I can't comment at this point how they will hold up over the course of the season. If you're like me, you don't want to spend a fortune on soccer shoes that your young one will wear a few times for one season. These were the best combination of comfort and affordability, in my opinion.
