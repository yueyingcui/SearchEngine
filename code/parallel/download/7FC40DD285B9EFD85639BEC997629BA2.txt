Timberland PRO Mudsill Low Steel Toe
Sizes seem to run a little small.
I had to return and get the next size up.
As someone who usually alternates between 6" ST boots and All-Star lo-tops, I decided that for the summer I would give a ST "sneaker" a try. The arch felt a little far forward on my one foot, but that is because my feet are a half-size apart. Moreover, I have low ankles, which these shoes cut into the moment I put them on. Such a shame.
I was pleasantly surprised by the extremely quick delivery. I wear a very large size shoe and was pleased at the selection available.
