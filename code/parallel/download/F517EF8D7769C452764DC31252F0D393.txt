Merrell Kids Skyjumper Z-Rap (Toddler/Youth)
I ordered 3 different brands in size four, for my daughter. One fit her great, one was close, but a little small, and these were a full size too big. Will confirm, once I get the size 3's. She loved the shoe, the style, and the velcro closure (she is 11).
