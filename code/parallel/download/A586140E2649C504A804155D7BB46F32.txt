Shimano SH-MT43
This shoe was disappointing mainly because of design. It was a little tight, not quite a half size smaller. The real problem was the lacing, which is hard to get tight, the design of the velcro lace strap, and the high extension at the top of the heel. All three made it a hassle to put on, or take off after a long ride. On the plus side, once you get the laces tight they stay tight.
