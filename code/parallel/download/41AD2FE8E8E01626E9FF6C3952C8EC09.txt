Well I didn't have much to choose from for a 12N shoe size and I was a little bit surprised to be putting on a clog style shoe but these are real comfortable and I would recommend them, especially to folks who are fanatic about removing shoes upon entering a house, these are so easy to slip on and off but the feel well attached to the feet for even brisk walking.
