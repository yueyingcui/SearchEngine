Lowa Renegade II GTX Lo
Better look than fit - 
I purchased the same size I always buy in Clarks or Ecco. These shoes seem to fit the first day but the second day they seem to give me problems on the right foot. I have been stretching them for the past week or more. I will try them again this week and see if the stretching helps. I have never had this problem with Clarks or Ecco's.
