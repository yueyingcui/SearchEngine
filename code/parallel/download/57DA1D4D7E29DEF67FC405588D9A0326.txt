New Balance WX1211
Runs small. I have several different syles of this brand of athletic shoe that are this size that fit me well, and are visibly longer when you put them side by side. 
I love these shoes. They are comfortable and they look good too.  I use them for walking as well as weight training.  I found that they runs mall so I had to order one size up.  I used a different insole for more arch support.
