Spira WaveWalker
I really love these shoes.  I put them on and they were perfect right out of the box.  Good enough arch and heel support that I do not need my orthotics with them.  I will definitely buy more.  I did buy a half size larger than usual and am glad I did.  The toe bed is marvelously wide, which means that I do not need a W width.  The shoe does not slide around at all, love them.
This is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. I am extremely happy with my purchase. I love the fit. The top of my feet are in pain most of the time and these shoes have helped tremendously. I would recommend this shoes to anyone who wants to be comfortable. I did get it half a size smaller like they recommended and this worked for me. Very happy with my purchase. Well worth the price.
