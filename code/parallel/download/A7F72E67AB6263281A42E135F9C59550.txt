I wear size 8.5 D/E shoes, and the 8.5D fit great. They have a nice hard sole, perfect for riding your bike. I am very pleased with these shoes.
Cool sneakers. Fit true to size and very comfortable. Get lots of compliments too.
This is an excellent sneaker. The materials and make are great. The feel is a little stiff (because is designed to push bike pedals) but after a while, it breaks-in and feels OK. This shoe, like some other brands that I have owned (Blundstone comes to mind) suffers from the feels one size bigger syndrome). I found out in this case that in due to the hefty thick insoles that push your toes against the top of the toe cap. So, lets say that you are a size 10. The length of the shoe is actually correct, but you feel that you need half of one size bigger. You go to 11 and you feel fine, but the shoes look too big on you. If you replace the soles with some after market ones, then the size 10 feels fine.
