adidas Kids Puntero VI TRX FG J (Toddler/Youth)
My daughter loves these cleats. The coloring is just on the pink side of red, but not too girlie. They fit nicely, laces stay tied. This is our 2nd pair of this shoe, and we were just as happy when she was in a smaller size.
Width was slightly larger than other cleats of a similar size. This is an important feature considering the shin guards and puffy cotton socks that kids wear. The shape and length of each cleat seams to provide more traction than other shoes with the more traditional round cleat.

Great and cute soccer shoe. My daughter loves them. I ordered a half size up.

I bought these a half size big to fit the socks and cleats. They have worked well and she loves the pink!
Bought these shoes for my daughter for soccer.  She loves wearing them!  After reading previous reviews, I ordered them a half size bigger than she wears.  They worked out perfectly!
Great cleats.  My daughter loved these shoes for soccer.  I would have given it 5 stars but I'm having to return them for a larger size since they run small.
