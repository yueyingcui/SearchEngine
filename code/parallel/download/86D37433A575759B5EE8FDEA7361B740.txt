Converse Sea Star
Awesome Shoe! These aren't true to size tho, when you wear them w/o socks they are, but with, they aren't, so get em a 1/2 size larger. Stylish, comfortable, and cheap describe these shoes. If the pictures don't satisfy you, take my word for it and buy these! Amazing shoes 10 out of 5 stars! Remember, 1/2 size larger and width is alright I guess.
Converse makes exellent and very durable shoes and the converse sea star is no exception. Comfortable and stylish. It brings new life to a timeless classic of the marine shoe style. Keep in mind though, that their shoes are in the narrow side. So when ordering, get the next half or full size. Other than that, they are outstanding!
Boat Shoe - 
Pleasantly surprised. Keep in mind that you won't be wearing socks with these shoes, so you could order a 1/2 size down and be fine.
If they get dirty, use a little bleach and you'll be golden (or white).
