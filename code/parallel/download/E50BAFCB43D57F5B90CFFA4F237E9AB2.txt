ASICS Kids Inspireâ„¢ GS (Toddler/Youth)
This is a cute shoe but is quite narrow in the toe box.  I had to go up 1 full size to get the width needed.  Also, there is not much support in the arch or sole.
We bought these for my daughter for school shoes. She wore them even though they were a little tight (we tried the next size up and they were too big) hoping they would loosen up. They seemed to fit lengthwise, but were very narrow. We felt uncomfortable returning them after she had worn them several times, so we just went ahead and bought her a different pair. These might be a good shoe choice for you if your child has a narrow foot.
