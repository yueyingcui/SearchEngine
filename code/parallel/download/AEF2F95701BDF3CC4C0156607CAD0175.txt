Vans Half CabÂ® Pro
Sk8 or die, bruh!
I've skated for over 10 years, and I got my first pair of Half-Cab pros less then a year ago and haven't looked back. They are true to size, stiff but not uncomfortable and very supportive, especially for skating. If you are on your feet all day, you might want to throw some insoles on them, but I've found they're a pretty good overall shoe. I like them so much I bought a pair to skate in and a pair to live/work in.
