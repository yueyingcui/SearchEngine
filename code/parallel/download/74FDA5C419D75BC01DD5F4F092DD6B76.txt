adidas Outdoor AX1
Great shoes- nice arch support, true to size, stylish, lightweight and breathable. Def recommend, may be getting another pair!
Been looking for a good sturdy hiking/tennis shoe for my husband. The Samba's just weren't cutting it. He really likes these. Said that the heel feels a little stiff, but overall they were comfortable. He has a wider foot, so we ordered a half size up.
I bought these sneakers for my husband. Buying shoes for him can be difficult due to his size (14-15). I found these Adidas and he loves them. They look great, they fit great are so comfortable. No one could beat the price either.
I purchased these for an overseas deployment for my job (military contractor), and I'm glad I did. The terrain here ranges from hard packed dirt, to large broken rock, to river rock, to sand. And when it rains it becomes a slippery mess. These shoes are very light but handle even the rocks with no worries. They are extremely well ventilated, very good for hot weather. The ventilation means you will get wet feet though when it rains, but they dry quickly. The size 11 I got seemed a bit short...tight on my big toe but not so much as to cause pain or blisters...but I think a 11.5 would be too big. I think it's because the toe naturally bends upward. All in all, very happy with these comfy, lightweight, tough shoes. They look cool too.
