Diadora Scudetto LT MD PU W
I wanted to try a new color for my cleats, so I thought the silver accent were nice. Knowing that they are all white I have accepted that they won't stay this color forever. After one use, I'm already seeing stains on the tongue. I originally ordered my usual 5.5 size, but ended up having to exchange for the 6. With wearing my slightly thicker socks, I felt the 5.5 were a bit too tight all around. They also seem to be keeping my feet dry on the wet grass, so that is a definite plus. Please note that I'm only playing in a rec league, so my usage is for leisure.
