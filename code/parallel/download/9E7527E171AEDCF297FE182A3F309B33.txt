New Balance WW577
I've worn New Balance shoes for exercise-walking for years. Generally, it's good to get a half size larger than one usually wears for this brand. I am 65 and after years of wearing high heels and other shoes meant for style rather than comfort, my feet have suffered. My toes now need plenty of room, but the rest of the foot is still relatively narrow. (it seems that NO ONE makes narrow width shoes anymore. I need to get a shoe that ties or has some way of adjusting the width. Lace-up shoes are no problem.) I add the previous comment in the hope that shoe manufacturers might take note. I wouldn't wear these shoes for anything but  exercise, not even to the grocery store; that doesn't really bother me, but it might some people. I do feel that the styling does verge on the "old lady," but then I guess I'm in that category. If there was a model that was this comfortable, but that looked sharp, I'd buy it rather than this one. The shoes are very comfortable for brisk walking; I'd been having trouble with foot pain, and that has lessened considerably.  I walk about 2 miles every day and am gradually increasing my distance. Yes, I'd buy these shoes again. I marked that they had moderate arch support; they're probably better than that, but I now have pretty high expectations for comfort and support. 
This shoe is true to size and width. A very comfortable walking pair. This is my second pair and will get another when these were out.
I ordered these in a size 5 extra wide and they fit well with my orthotic. The sole is quite flexible.
These shoes fit perfectly and felt comfortable from the first moment I wore them. True to size, width and quality -- I will definitely be looking for this same shoe when it comes time to purchase again.
I've been wearing size 8.5 New Balance for years, but this pair is a tad short and I think it needs to go back.
