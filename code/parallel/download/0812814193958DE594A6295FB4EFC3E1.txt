Converse Kids Jack PurcellÂ® CP Ox (Toddler/Youth)
Great fit for a woman's size 7 Wide . Ordered a Kids 6 and had enough width and length.  I think I could probably get away with a Kids 5, as the 6 seemed to run a little long. There is more cushion in this shoe than in Keds or Supergas, and seems better suited for walking longer distances. I cannot typically wear regular adult Converse shoes because they are too narrow and sizing up is uncomfortable since my foot flops around. Plus, kids sizes are cheaper. Will definitely order more colors. 
These shoes are very cute.  I bought them for my daughters to wear with casual skirts and dresses on days when sandals might be less conducive to play outside.  However, everyone should know that they run pretty big.  I had to go a size down for each of them in order to get them to fit.
I love the style, and this was my first Converse Jack Purssel. I'm size 8M and 6Youth, but this shoes was way to big, at least 1/2 size to 1 full size big. I could not exchange for smaller size once it was out of stock. I'm planing to order the leather one in women size.
Love these for my everyday shoes! Very cute & comfy for petite figure women like me. I'm glad I read others' reviews cause they do run a whole size big! The only thing is laces keep getting undone because of their material. But that's not a biggy - $2 lace change did the trick!
