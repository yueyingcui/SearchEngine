SIDI Dominator 5 Women's 
I have mountain bike pedals on my road bike, so I was a bit limited for the shoes I could use. I am very happy to have found these SIDIs. They are very comfortable, have a nice rigid base, so I won't lose any power up my hills and they fit like a dream. I usually wear a size 7 in everything, these were marked 7.5/39.5. So the sizing is a bit strange, but they are great!
I ride a touring bike probably a couple hundred miles a week. I bought this new pair with the ratcheting (versus the cheaper 3-velcro strap version). I have high arches and I feel like SIDI misses here. I had to buy arch inserts, so now we are almost to a couple hundred dollars for a pair of cycling shoes... is it worth it?? Well, I have no numbness after 50 miles - I count this as positive. I DO feel like I achieve a good stride on the bike. I DO like the ratchet. I feel like it stabilizes my foot longer than with just Velcro. I can also get off the bike and walk around in these, so overall, I am happy.
More on fit: I wear a 7.5 - in almost every shoe - an occasional 7. In European sizing I wear a 38 or 38.5. SIDIs sizing is way off. I could wear the 38.5, but a little on the snug size and then with the arch insert in place, I felt maxed out in the shoe - so I ended up with the 39s, which are a little big. Note, the web site calls their 39 a 7 - I just do not think this is true and have read this sizing problem on other sites that sell this shoes.

I have put 100 miles on them so far. The tongue kind of poked at my ankle but its breaking in. Velcro and ratcheting device are really secure, but the tab on the ratchet closure feels flimsy, we shall see how long it lasts. As for fit. I wear an 8.5 in most woman's shoes, Asics and Brooks. I found the size 41 too big, and the 40.5 was not small at all. I would say i don't have particularly wide or narrow feet
