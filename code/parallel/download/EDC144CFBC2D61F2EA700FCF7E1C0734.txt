Sperry Top-Sider Sperry Cup 2-Eye
Comfortable, but make sure you order a size or two below what you normally would. They will feel tight at first, but after a couple weeks they settle in very nicely. Great arch support, which I've heard is a problem with most of the boat shoes out there.
A great shoe - comfortable, true to size. Can be worn for casual occasions or dressed up, they are great!
The shoes are very comfortable. They are not true to size. I usually wear a 11 1/2. I had to order a 10 1/2.
