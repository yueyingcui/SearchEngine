New Balance WC851
Finally, a low volume shoe! This one does not have enough heel support with orthotics inserted. The toe box is a bit too narrow and long so a 1/2 -size smaller would be way too narrow. Too bad since it's really a cute looking shoe on! It's NOT lightweight despite being part mesh. This is my first try at wearing New Balance since the last never fit right. They have been redesigned so the sole seems to fit better but the toe box would need to have a little more volume for my particular foot. Too bad. Would try New Balance again though now!
