Mizuno Wave® Ronin™ 4 
Mizuno ruined these shoes! I've had all the previous Wave Ronins (1-3) and I've used them for training and racing and I loved them. I am an elite runner, 150 lbs and mid-forefoot striker. The biggest problem to the previous models was too wide of a heel. But I could over look this problem because they had a wide forefoot with allowed for free movement and widening on impact. Now Mizuno did just the opposite of what they needed to do with the shoe. They narrowed the forefoot, and kept a wide heel. Almost impossible to find a good fit. Tried 3 different sizes( 10.5, 11, 11.5) Will go back to Asics!
A good light pair of shoes if you would prefer to run barefoot but need a little support and are uneasy about running barefoot. I bought the Ronin 3 as well and it as the same quality and minimalist feel. I would not buy these if you need a stability shoe or more support for running. I have normal pronation so these work well for me. I did have to go up 1 whole size - in street shoes I wear a 6.5-7 (leaning more towards a 6.5) and I ended up taking an 8 in this shoe (the 7.5 fit perfectly but I needed a little more space in my toe area for sliding so I took the 8, if there was a 7.75 I would have taken that). The only thing I wish is that is it would come in different colors! But I am buying the shoe for the quality and what it does - not for the looks but I can hope and wish!
Love the shoes, but they run about a half size small. Really light and great otherwise.
