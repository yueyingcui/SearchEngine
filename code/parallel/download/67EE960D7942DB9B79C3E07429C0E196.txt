Nike Action Kids Mavrk Mid 2 Jr (Toddler/Youth)
Slightly narrow, and shorter.  Size up at least a 1/2 size.  Had to get a 5 for my son who should be a 4.
These are great shoes! They are very stylish for my seven year old. He loves them. They fit well and the high-top is not too high. True to size.
