These shoes are extremely snug fitting. I should've bought a full size larger. Also, they are very cheaply made. They look very nice, but I bought mine at the end of March, didn't start wearing them until mid-April. It is now August and the sole has completely separated from the fabric. I'm hard on shoes, I wear them 18+ hours a day in a demanding job and it's not unusual for me to wear a pair out in 8-10 months, but this has to be a new record for me. Also, they were initially very uncomfortable to wear (again, they were *definitely* sized small) and the breaking in process took at least a month.
