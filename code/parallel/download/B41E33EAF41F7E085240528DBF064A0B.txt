PUMA Drift Cat 4 Suede
Love these. If you want something to wear with shorts that doesn't create a big dark foot with khaki shorts, this is it. Note: Puma generally run a size small, but these run 2 sizes small. I wear a 12.5 and had to get size 14.
Fits tight. Order a larger size than you would expect. I wear a 13 in most shoes, I need a 14 in this pair. They are extremely comfortable and look great.
Had to order a half size larger than my normal size. Great shoe so far. I love the suede look. They are comfortable for everyday wearing, but not too great if you are going to walk more than 2 miles at once. Like all Puma's I have worn they are very light weight.
