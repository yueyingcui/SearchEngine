New Balance MC656
great shoes, they fit my feet great witch is usually a challenge for having 4e shoe sizes. they look even better and person and it seem that everyone like them.
I ordered the 656 to replace my 653s (EE) which I use for racquetball. The 656 uses the MX-001 last which has replaced the SL-1 last in everything but running and walking shoes. The SL-1 has a better snugger heel cup and a squarer toe box. Although both shoes are size 11 the 656 is a good half inch longer with a tapered front. The inside of the toe box slopes in toward the front of the shoe. Whose big toe slopes inward? Bring back the SL-1 and even the gum sole for indoor use (made briefly, even for EE).
You guys are the greatest.    Super fast USPS delivery.   Thanks for treating us in Hawaii like the rest of the US.   Shoes were perfect, true to size.    Only ones I can use, as New Balance comes in wide sizes.  Great shoe!  Great service!
As a first time on line order, the shoes are good. I could have got a size 10 instead of 10 1/2 though. Testing particular brand and size prior to order would have helped.
Good shoe though and Zappo's system is good. 
Excellent fit and comfort, but bought a 10.5 instead of a size 10 (my usual size) and it fit great.
