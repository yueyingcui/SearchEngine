Converse Kids Chuck Taylor® All Star® Street Ox Slip (Infant/Toddler)
These are way too big for my son which is weird because size 8 in Nike fits perfect and we even used the foot measurement thing at the store before ordering these. A coworker told me Converse always run big. Wish I knew that before ordering. I will still exchange them because they are super cute.
