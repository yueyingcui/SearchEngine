Nike Inflict
Bought for my son and he really likes the shoe. Did go up a 1/2 size based on the previous comments and it worked out great.
My 13 year old loves his new wrestling shoes. They are made well, but we needed to order a full size and a half larger since they run very small.

I wear size 9 mens, so I ordered 9 1/2. I had to unlace them all the way to the toe just to get my foot into it. They are very narrow, and I have a narrow foot. 9 1/2 felt like a size 8 to me if that helps.
