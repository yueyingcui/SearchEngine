Converse Jack PurcellÂ® LP Ox
Classic looking shoe, comfortable, but if you have wide feed, they are a little tight. I would get a half size larger to accommodate. Good shoe for casual, dressed down. Appear to be easily washable.
These shoes rock! I have wide feet and they have plenty of room unlike chucks. They are true to size. If you like them, get them you will not be disappointed! Only con would be I wish they had a little more cushion on the bottom.
