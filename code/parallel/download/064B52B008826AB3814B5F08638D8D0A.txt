adidas Originals Spezial
There is definitely something different about this version of the Spezial. They actually have some noticeable arch support. There are actual curves on the insole. This time I bought same sized Sambas and Spezials. The sizing on Spezials is always different. These Spezials are larger than any previous pair. They measure about 1/4" longer than the equivalent size Samba. The toebox is pointier but it is also taller. On this version, there is a large curve from the tip for plenty of room. The last version had almost a flat toe. So, you may order a half size smaller than normal. But, because of the actual arch support, they may feel weird with a different size. A little room in the toe doesn't hurt.
