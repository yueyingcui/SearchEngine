New Balance Kids KG633 (Infant/Toddler)
I was very pleased with this shoe and for the most part, still am. I ended up returning them. Here is why. My son who is 2.5 years old constantly kicks dirt, rocks, sand, mulch, etc. Well, we are out and about a lot. We have horses, we go to the park, we hike, etc. Every time I took his shoes off, he would have dirt all over his socks and all over his feet. I would have to wash his feet every time we came inside the house. This was very frustrating. At first, I thought it was just a one-time thingâ€¦ that he really just kicked too much dirt. However, it was every time we went outside. The mesh in the toe of these allows too much inside the shoe. It is really large in size and nothing is really preventing small particles from getting in the shoe. If your child isn't an active kicker of anything with dirt in it, I would say they are great. If they are, I would not buy these.
