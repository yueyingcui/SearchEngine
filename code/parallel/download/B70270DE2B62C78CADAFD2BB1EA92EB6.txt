Globe Fusion
These shoes (sadly) replaced my last pair of Globe Chet IVs in black. The Chet IV is the only non-dress shoe that I have purchased or worn in the last 10 years, but as you may know, they were discontinued a few years ago and are very difficult to find now. I bought these Fusions because I needed black tennis shoes and I wanted something that was as close to the Chet IVs as I could get. The Globe Fusions do have the built-in sock/tongue setup, which is the feature that set the Chet IV apart from the rest years ago. In my opinion, that goes a long way for comfort of these shoes, but there's something else that's not quite the same. I would give them about a 7/10 for comfort, with a 10 being the CT-IVs. For style...well, they're okay in all black, but I'm probably just hung up on the fact that they're not really the shoes I want. Besides, you can see from the pictures and decide whether you like them or not. One comment regarding size, they run about a half size bigger than the Chet IV's. To summarize, I think this is the best alternative to the Globe Chet IVs which have been discontinued, but if you love your Chet IV's like I do, you're still going to be disappointed.
