adidas Outdoor Terrex Fast X GTX
These are great shoes.  I normally wear solomon hiking shoes but decided to try these.  They have excellent support and the soles grip well.  They run a little big though.  Had to size down to a 10. Also, they are a little rarrow which is good for my foot.
It's a beautiful shoe but narrow around the toe box.  Couldn't go a half size larger because it would be too long.
I don't know why other reviews claim that these Adidas width runs true. They are definitely
narrower than normal. For the price (they are expensive) Adidas should offer at least 3 width sizes (narrow, normal and wide).
These worked out well. Bought them for a Europe trip and wore them for 17 days. Didn't break them in for more than a week before the trip. They stayed tight pretty much all day and were comfortable even if not tightened. Didn't have a chance to test the waterproof much, but we encountered a little rain and I did not get wet feet. I ordered the size 8 initially which normally fits me fine and I decided to get the 8 1/2 instead since the 8's were just a little tight especially if thicker socks were worn.
