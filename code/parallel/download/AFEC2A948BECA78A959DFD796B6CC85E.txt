The North Face Kids Single-Track II (Toddler/Youth)
Very nice pair of shoes. Easy on and off perfect for a six year old. The rubber on the front end is already peeling after a couple of weeks, but my son is very hard on his shoes. Seems to think they are very comfortable. I had to send back the first pair and order a full size smaller as they seem to run big.
