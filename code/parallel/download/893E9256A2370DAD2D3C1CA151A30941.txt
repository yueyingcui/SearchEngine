Ryka Desire
I got these after months of searching for a good kickboxing gym shoe. They are awesome! The first day they feel tight or even too small but that goes away after 4 times wearing but if you hate tight shoes I would go 1/2 size bigger. To my surprise they are also great for running moderate distance; however, I wouldn't call them running shoes.
I absolutely love this shoe! I love feeling like I am standing on a cloud, and this shoe offers that. Also, I like a minimal feel when I run, but I am not ready to go "Vibram" style. This is a great in-between for running and general cross training. I also teach aerobics in this shoe and love the feeling, although those with weaker ankles will obviously not feel comfortable with that. I do think next time I would order one size below my regular Ryka/sneaker size. They stretched a little on me after a longer run (3 miles). Definitely get this shoe!
