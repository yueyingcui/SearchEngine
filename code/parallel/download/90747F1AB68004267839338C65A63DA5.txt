Nike Air Flight '89
This shoe is great! I was skeptical about this sneaker because I have tried on similar Jordan brand sneakers at Foot Locker and they were always hard and lacking cushion. This sneaker fits me perfectly and has a lot of comfy cushion in the ankle area. I was also worried that these would be too high because I look silly in high top sneakers. These are more of a mid top much like the Jordan IV. I wear a size 10 in Nike Air Max 1's because I like my shoes a little loose and the toe box is mesh but I purchased a 9.5 in this shoe to prevent toe box creasing. They fit great and I feel fresh to death.
