Salomon Exit 2 GTXÂ®
I really like these shoes. They are my second pair of waterproof Salomons. My first pair lasted very well for several years, and they were just starting to lose some of the support as well as not be as waterproof. I wear a women's size 11, and I found that the men's size 9 was a little too small for me, and I exchanged for a 10 which fit great. I also have narrow feet, so a lot of men's shoes are too wide for me, but I did no have that problem with these. Now I am pregnant, and my feet have grown almost a full size, so I am going to purchase a men's size 11. I wear these for walking, light hiking, and anything around water. I have found they are completely waterproof and keep my feet dry even when fully submerged, although I have not had them submerged for long periods of time. I definitely recommend these shoes for men or women!
First pair of Salomon shoes. Quality exceeds my best expectations. Comfortable and perfect fit, true to size. Very, very happy.
