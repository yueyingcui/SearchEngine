Emerica The Reynolds Chiller
If you're interested in this shoe, it's important to know that it has no laces. What I mean by this is it fits more loosely than other shoes. So, if you're a size 11 normally you might want to bump down to a 10.5 or 10 (this was the case for me. I currently have a size 10, it's a little tight but once I wear them more often they'll break in.). Returns with this website are effortless and quick, so don't feel like you have to stick with the shoe if you're not satisfied.
