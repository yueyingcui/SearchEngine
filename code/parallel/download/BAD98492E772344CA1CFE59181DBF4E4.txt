adidas F10 TRX FG
This is my third pair of soccer cleats in the past two years and they are by far the best! No blisters, adjusts perfectly to the shape of your foot, great touch and sensitivity to the ball. I play every weekend, very competitive games, played five games with them so far, they still look like new, I got them in black, and I doubt I will ever go back. I wear an 11Â½ and that is the size I ordered them in and the fit perfectly. They were the best deal ever!
