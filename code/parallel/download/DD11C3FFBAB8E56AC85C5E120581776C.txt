Vans Chauffeur
Never had so many compliments on a pair of shoes in my life.  These are stylish enough for a wedding (check) and relaxed enough for a skate session (check).  These fit a bit tighter than the vans rata vulc, but are accurately sized overall.  Super lightweight and incredibly comfortable.  Get some!
I must say, I really have been enjoying these shoes for the summer. They're comfy and stylish. Just a heads up though, these shoes are not meant to be worn with socks. If you really have to wear socks, I recommend getting a half size bigger. The inside is made of rubber, almost like water shoes. I thought that my feet would sweat, but they don't and do rashing from the back part either. Total summer shoe!
I just got these today and I love them! I have kind of wide feet, so if you plan on wearing socks I suggest you get half a size bigger. These are awesome and very stylish shoes.
