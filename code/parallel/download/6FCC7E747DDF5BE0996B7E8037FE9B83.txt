Converse Work Full Capacity
Great comfy shoes, no one can believe they are built for work. It's a shame to get em dirty on the job! Little on the heavy side and definitely get them a half size smaller than your usual sneaker but still awesome!
I needed a steel toe for customer site visits.  Something that could walk me around most worksites yet I could still make an executive presentation.  This shoe has been a good choice to meet those needs.  Slight heaviness due to steel toe but comfortable to wear all day.  Made a business trip and wore these shoes the entire time.  Runs 1/2 size large though!
I have found these to be everything as advertised. They are very comfortable and fit true to size. I was surprised by the weight of the shoes but that is to be expected with the steel toe.
Great shoes. Lite and comfortable. Ordered one size smaller than what I usually wear and they fit great.
Do yourself a favor and get the high tops instead. These shoes are awful. First off, they are not even a little bit slip resistant! If anything, I would call them slip persistent. I've had these for about 3 weeks, and they haven't gotten any better. Second, they are def. a 1/2 size too big. And third, they have no support whatsoever. Buy these if you like ice skating (with ice skates that are too big and generally uncomfortable).
These are casual shoes. I did not know that Converse make steel toe shoe. Buy Â½ an inch smaller than your shoe size.
Great comfortable shoes, hard to find steel toe shoes this style. On my 2nd pair, first pair was a little large for the size I ordered so the heel wore out after 7 months. Got a half size smaller this time.
