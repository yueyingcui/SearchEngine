Macbeth McQueen
I purposely bought a half size up because I noticed with a previous purchase that these run a little narrow. I love Macbeths though and always will. They hold up super well and they have a large line of vegan styles. This is my third pair in my current rotation but the first time I had purchased a grey tone. The grey is good - not too black or blueish. This has not been the case with other grey shoes but this particular tone is easy to incorporate if you are used to wearing mostly black shoes.
I already liked Macbeths but these ones are vegan which sealed the deal. They are narrow for my feet so next time I might get a half size bigger to have sufficient room for my toes. I have been wearing them for almost 5 months and the integrity of the shoes have held up. Canvas color is still rich and the sole is still intact with regular to high frequency wear (3-4 times a week).
