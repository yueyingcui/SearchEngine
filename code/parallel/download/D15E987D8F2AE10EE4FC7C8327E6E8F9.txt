New Balance Kids KV689 (Infant/Toddler)
These are great shoes that I bought for my two year old son. He loves them! I bought them for the arch support. Originally I bought different shoes, but then realized that is not a good idea. I called the customer service, and they helped me buy the best possible shoes for the arch support in that size, they even send me those the next morning, while I still had the other shoes. That was great service, from a great company!
Love these sneakers. Buy a 1/2size larger than shoe they are wearing. The velcro close is great and tight, unlike some that stretch this one doesn't. Love it, great fit and easy for my 3.5 year old to put on and off himself.
This is my daughter's first pair of non-Stride Rite shoes. She loves these -- her first pair of "big girl" shoes. At first, these were snug, and we almost sent them back for a larger size. After a week of wear, they broke in. My daughter never complained of any discomfort, even during the break-in week.
