Vans Chukka Low
The first thing to emphasize about the Vans Chukka Low is that it has a very adhesive sole designed for skate-boarding and similar activities.  I am using it mainly as a driving shoe since it give such good traction with the car's accelerator and brakes. The second thing is that the thickly padded tongue may come as a surprise, but it is an essential part of the design in that its keeps your feet firmly in touch with the adhesive soles.  
The shoe looks abnormally long and narrow for a size 9.0. I guess "good board feel" means no arch support. You can literally feel pebbles and rocks on your feet as you walk. These shoes are very uncomfortable. Too bad because their style is unique and I was really wanting to like them. 
I liked the style of the shoes, but in the end, the shoe felt bigger than the actual size. My feet could not get comfortable in them, even after waiting to break the shoes in. Also, the lip was not comfortable either (was "hard" and pushed against my feet at times, maybe I am used to skater shoes with the bigger, yet comfortable lips). I got the bare minimum size for my feet yet my feet felt loose in the shoe. Shoe looked good though.
The laces were really short, and they are just really crammed in inside. I was at the biggest size (1 size more than I usually get) and it was still too small. They look really nice, so I would recommend it, if you can fit in them. I'm just rating in my experience, nothing against the style.
Exactly what I was looking for! Very comfy, true to size and easy to put with an outfit. I got the Chukkas because of the cushioned tongue. It helps prevent walking on the back of my pants cuff (I wear a lot of relaxed fit jeans) while still maintaining the classic Vans look and comfort. This is far from my last pair. Gotta keep a pair of fresh whites! While I'm thinking about it, it is just about time to get a new pair! Happy shopping folks!
