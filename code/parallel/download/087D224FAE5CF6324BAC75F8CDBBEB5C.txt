Vans Half Cab™ Core Classics
I have very wide feet and have looked high and low for a comfortable skate shoe. These fit like a glove right out of the box. My last pair of shoes (Ocean Pacific) I got in size 13 and they took like a month to break in. These I tried in a size 14 for some extra width. They fit like slippers, they were so incredibly comfortable. There was still some break-in for the next week or two, but they didn't pinch at all, and they streched out real nice. They look great and have a tough construction. Vans rocks!
These are probably the best skate shoe's I've ever owned.At first they seem they might be a bit clunky or big but they do not feel that way on your feet. They have just enough padding where you can feel your board but not get heel bruises. They are true to size unlike a lot of Vans.
Shoes arrived ahead of time. Knew size from previous purchase so fit was perfect. Quality was better than expected. Reading the label we found it was all leather upper. Great price for leather shoes.
Sickest shoe ever from Vans. The comfort was amazing. Amazing board feel, they're decently durable and just the best. Definitely will get many more pairs. The only thing is order a half size smaller because I ordered my normal size and they were really big. Also adding more footbeds is a good idea.
Yeah - 
Definitely one of the best skateboard shoes ever, although they wear out kind of quick. I’ve had about 6 pairs of them and still get ‘em occasionally. Careful though, they stretch, so buying half a size smaller isn’t a bad idea.
