Creative Recreation Cesario
These shoes are sick! Ran slightly small so I ordered one size up for my BF.  Could not have been happier.
I love to see Creative Recs on a guy so I bought the Cesario for my boyfriend. He wears a size 11 and after the reviews I decided to order an 11.5. Once they arrived promptly 2 days after ordering (very speedy) he tried them on they were still a little too snug for him. So I had to return (wish I could have exchanged) and order a 12 which work perfect. So if ordering these, go up a whole size for comfort.
Love the shoes (black perfs), they do run about a half to a full size smaller. Definitely worth the purchase, received many compliments on them. Don't think twice, don't hesitate, go for it! You won't regret buying. Promise.
This shoe rocks! However make sure to order one full size above your regular sneaker size. Also comfort wise, it has also no support so make sure to buy some soles. In addition the first few times I wore this, it was hurting me in my Achilles heal but after the third time it was all good. You know what they say about the 3rd time. If you want the super fresh look without being so concerned about comfort, go for it!
Shoe runs small and they don't have a larger size for me to order. They definitely run a size smaller. The sole isn't very comfortable either, I suggest getting an insole. The appearance of them is awesome though (the leather and suede ones).
These shoes are awesome--they look sexy and are comfortable (as long as you get 1/2 size or 1 size up). I wear size 11 but size 11 in this shoe was way small. I ordered 12s and they're perfect.
