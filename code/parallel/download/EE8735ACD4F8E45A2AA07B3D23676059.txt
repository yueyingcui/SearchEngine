Saucony Grid Crossfire
For a person with wide flat feet, I found them a little tight. I wish they came available in a wide width. But they are still comfortable and light for those short bursts of running my job requires. And they look pretty good with blue jeans. Other standard Saucony shoes fit me at a size 11-11Â¾. I had to get these in a size 12 to fit.
This was my first experience with Saucony, so I started with these sneakers which are slightly less expensive than their other running shoes. I love them! I purchased them in April, and during the test walk around the house I was really impressed with the light-weight foam and smooth mesh. They are comfortable with or without socks. I love the laces, they are made of a rougher material than I have seen and they don't loosen or un-lace throughout the day. After one mishap in the rain I wore them strictly when the weather was clear -- just walking through dewy grass could soak my feet. I purchased a women's size 10 and if I stretch my toes out they just graze the toebox, I find this comfortable and would say they are perfect to size. At the beginning of July I was bummed to find the "GXT-600 carbon rubber" on the bottom of the shoe completely worn down (see the triangle sections) and starting to wear at the green foam. This was to be expected, seeing as I would wear them all day, on pavement, and I tend to grind my feet a little. But I would buy these again in a heartbeat, and if I worked out in a gym I would imagine they would last much longer.
