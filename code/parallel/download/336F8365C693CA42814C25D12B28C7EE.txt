New Balance WRC5000
At 2.8 ounces for a women's size 8, these are the lightest running shoes in my closet. Hands down, they are also my favorite, with the New Balance Minimus Zero Road a close second. Although marketed as racing flats, they're great for experienced minimalist runners. Feather light, grippy, and breathable. I don't even notice the 4mm drop compared to the 0mm shoes I also run in. The Revlite soles may be too squishy for the minimalist-shoe purist, but I've come to love it, especially on runs longer than 10 miles.

I was a bit concerned about durability because these are just ridiculously lightweight, but I've run 200-plus miles in them so far, including many runs longer than 10 miles, and they are holding up just fine. The black nubbins on the soles don't even show signs of wear.
