ASICS Gel-Upshotâ„¢  W
Comfy! I like these shoes, they fit great, true to size. They have good arch support which I need with my high arches. I've worn them shopping, and don't get tired, sore feet. The metallic pink part is quite cool, but not what I'd call over the top. 
Just a great training shoe.  I highly recommend it.  Looks terrific. It's  very comfortable.  Provides perfect support for training.  True to size.  I love this shoe!
Great workout shoes for high-impact aerobics or any activity requiring a lot of jumping. Terrific cushioning support in the forefoot makes for best comfort I have ever had in an aerobic shoe. Would like a little more width in the toe box, but not bad. Feels true to size.
Amazing shipping speed! Shoes so comfortable, I don't want to take them off! For walking and workouts, this shoes is perfect: great stabilization, support and cushioning. The interior feels cozy and supportive. Love it! I always buy my walking shoes in a size to accommodate thick socks-1 size up. This worked in these shoes too.
I ordered this shoes for my cross training. They run narrow and long. I had to return them. I am a size 6 and wanted to order half size less but this shoe doesn't come in 5.5. 
Too bad.
