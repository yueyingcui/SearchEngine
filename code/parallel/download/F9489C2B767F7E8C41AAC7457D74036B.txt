Patagonia Javelina A/C
Solid! Love the orange highlights, but not great for the office. I've owned some similar Patagonia's I'd wear to work, not these. They're perfect everyday shoes for people who want an outdoor sneaker with a skate shoe look and light hiker feel. I had to order a full size larger then my normal 8.5, I'm perfect with a 9.5 with these shoes. Patagonia does not specialize in shoes, but these are manufactured by Wolverine, and branded Patagonia. Wolverine makes Merrell and tons of other brands. The quality is very good, not top of the line.
