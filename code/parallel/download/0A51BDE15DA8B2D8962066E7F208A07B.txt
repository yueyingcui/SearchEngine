Sebago Docksides
These shoes are really great. They are noticeably sturdier (and I think better-made) than Top Siders, with more arch support as well. I would recommend trying half a size down if you plan on wearing them without socks. They are great shoes!
It's hard to compare these to other boat shoes since this is my first pair.  Sizing wise, I typically wear 10.5 for most shoes but I decided for a size 10.  It actually worked out for me since I only planned to wear these with/without thin loafer socks.  First wear, the leather was pretty stiff and a little tight in the toe area.  It took a couple wears for the leather to finally break-in and mold around my feet.  The leather also stretched enough where the small tightness in the toe is gone.  Otherwise, they are comfortable as heck and look good with everything.  I do plan to pick up another pair in a different color.
First off these run large -- anywhere from a half to a full size. Second, they're stiff as the top-side of the deck. Third, if you want comfort right out of the box, go with some Sperry Top-Siders. They've gotten negative reviews but man, they fit like a glove. These Docksides are top-notch quality, but like many reviewers noted, are uncomfortable. 
These are a comfortable, casual shoe with good fit options.  For a larger foot size (we bought them in a 13 wide), there are not a lot of shoes available, and these were similar to a fashion brand that didn\'t carry the size we needed.  They came in 3 widths which was more than we expected.
Had to return these and get them a half size smaller. My son loves these, and he is very particular. The wide width was perfect for him. They were comfortable walking long distances immediately, without socks!
