ASICS Kids Gel-Galaxyâ„¢ 5 (Youth)
Great shoe! This is our  third version of this sneaker, we just keep going up a few sizes, as needed.
These are great looking shoes, but they run quite a bit narrow on my otherwise medium size footed son. I really wish they had fit, but it looks like we will be picking out something else!
