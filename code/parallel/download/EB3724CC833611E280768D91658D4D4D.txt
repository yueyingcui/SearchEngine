Converse Work Live Roller
Very good shoe. Very light for a protected toe. The only problem is the sizes for these shoes run very large. I wear a size 11-11.5 in every shoe I have ever tried, with these I wear a size 9. So keep that in mind when you order.
Fantastic shoe. I work in a machine shop for ten hours a day. I have purchased many different brands of steel toe shoes and boots and these are by far the most comfortable pair of work shoes I have ever owned. As another review points out they are sized bigger than normal. I have been a size 12 since the age of 15 and a pair of these shoes in 12 felt 3 sizes to big. I would recommend ordering 2 sizes below your actual size.
Great shoes. Very sturdy and good looking. I really like them. Be warned, though, they're big shoes! With the reinforced toe cap and all that, they're pretty bulky. Also, the 10.5s that I ordered fit like 11.5s. Possibly a bit more. I couldn't even touch the front of the shoe when shoving forward quite hard. So I returned them for a smaller size. (My true shoe size is 10.5 and has been for 25 years.)
