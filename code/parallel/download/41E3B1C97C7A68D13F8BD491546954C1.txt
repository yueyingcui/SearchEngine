Nike Kids Land Shark 3/4 BG (Toddler/Youth)
My son says these are very comfortable (and they are definitely pretty slick-looking). They seem well-made too and the black upper wasn't stiff so there wasn't a "break-in" time. The dark colors are ideal for hiding the dirt and grass stains! We had to exchange for 1/2 size larger.
