Heelys Stingray (Toddler/Youth)
My 6 year old son bought these and loves them.   I asked him about the comfort and size and he said they felt fine!
Grandson loves these, ordered 1 size bigger so he can take his time to get to pro level.
My son loves these shoes. He comes home from school and they are the first thing he does. He now asks when are we going to Walmart so he can skate around while I shop. They are true to size and was pretty easy to learn. We watched a video of how to learn on the internet and within two days he was a pro. I would definitely say buy these shoes. And with the free returns, you cant go wrong. But if you do, it doesn't cost a thing to try another size. Buy them! Wish I had them when I was a kid.
Ordered these shoes for my grandson and they were just what he wanted. Had trouble with the sizing. Size 2 was way too large and a size 1 was a snug fit. Think maybe there should be some half sizes.

Shoes are great. Marked with wheel/plug sizes in case you want to convert them to regular shoes.
