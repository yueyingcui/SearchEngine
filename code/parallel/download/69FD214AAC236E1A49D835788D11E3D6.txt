Five Ten Atlas
I just got these shoes probably about an hour ago and I'm still wearing them. Out of the box they look well made and right away I tried them on. The feel comfortable and true to size. They are a little narrow on the toes, but it not bad for the normal width foot. This is also expected for Five Ten shoes. This is one of their newest shoes out this year (2012) and my primary use will be for Parkour. Before this shoe I was using the Five Ten Warhawk, but as soon as I saw a version made more like a sneaker I jumped on it. They're light weight and flexible. With the their trademark stealth rubber no obstacle will slow me down. I'll update this review once I'm able to hit the streets in them.
