ASICS GEL-KahanaÂ® 6
These shoes are true to size, feel cushiony yet are stable and grippy on trails. I wore them for a 7 mile trail race with no break in required!
I love these shoes!  I originally purchased 5 pairs of size 12 stability running shoes and was very pleased as soon as I tried on this pair and ran around my house!  I confirmed this great fit with my next outdoor  5 mile run.  They are well cushioned and my feet feel secure but not squeezed.  My feet are somewhat narrow but I like plenty of toe-wiggling room.  The snug fit of the heel is also ideal.  I'm 5'9'' and 132 lbs.  I do wish it had some reflective markings.  I also use Rx orthotics in place of the insole.
