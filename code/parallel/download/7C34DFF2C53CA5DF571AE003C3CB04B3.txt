Clarks Seneka
Nice looking shoe and fairly comfortable, but runs at least a half-size large. My toes had a bit more wiggle room at the end than I would have preferred, and I sometimes found my heels sliding up and down in the shoe. I would order these again, but a half-size smaller.

As far as the width goes, I ordered wide and I think they ran true to size in this regard. The toe box is wide and roomy and gives you enough space for proper toe spread.
