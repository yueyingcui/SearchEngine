Tretorn Kids Nylite Canvas SS '11 (Toddler/Youth)
10 year old boy loves these shoes. He preferred the slightly larger size (1/2 size above normal) so he can slip in and out easily without tying. They are unique around here, and he feels like he's started his own trend!
I ordered these for my niece after she told me she liked MY pink Tretorns. So now we match! :) Just like the adult version, these are just as cute. We did go up a half-size with her, as one foot is slightly longer than the other. But they run pretty true to size. The kids version comes with 2 types of laces - one white, one pink/yellow ribbon. She loves them. Her mom likes them because they are easy to wash - a little OxyClean and they look like new. Great for a girl who wants a casual tennis shoe that still looks girlie.
