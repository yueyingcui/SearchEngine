Vans Kids Old Skool Core Classics (Infant)
I absolutely love these! My daughter started wearing them (size 3) at six months. They do not fall off like the slip-on ones since you can tie them tighter. They are crib shoes so the soles are soft.
These little shoes are so cute but are smaller then the actuall size I think. I ordered a 2 thinking my baby would grow in to them but I couldn't even squeeze his feet in to them. I had to send them back for a larger size.
I am on the second pair of these for my son. I ordered my first pair (size 1) when he was 2 months old and they fit perfect. We are on our second pair now and he is 5 months old and has been wearing a size 2 for a few weeks; I think he will need a size 3 very soon. The Vans are soft, flexible, and stay on their feet. I received several compliments about how adorable they are. I highly recommend the shoes; they are just precious!
These are the cutest!  While they are expensive for baby shoes, they are truly adorable.  We wear them most days so I can justify the expense. I'd recommend buying a size larger.

Super cute baby shoes. Appears comfy as my daughter doesn't try to remove them. I did buy them a size larger to last a little longer as babies don't seem to stay one size for too long.
