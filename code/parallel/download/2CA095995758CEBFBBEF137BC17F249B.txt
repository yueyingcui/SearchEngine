Converse Kids All Star&reg; V3 Ox (Toddler/Youth)
We bought these half a size larger than the size my daughter is about to outgrow. But they fit huge! They're at least a full size larger than ordered. We considered returning them, but we decided to hold them for when she fully outgrows her current sneakers. Then she'll just have to wear double socks or something. 

My daughter loves these sneakers. She has wide feet and I usually need to order stride rites. These are great in the width. I did order a size down and they fit perfect. She is a 12 but I ordered an 11 and they fit good with a little room for winter. I love the velcro.
Love these shoes! Perfect for preschool, look great with all of her outfits. They do run big. We ordered a size smaller, and she still has room to grow.

Great fit and quality for my narrow-footed 5-year old. Ran true to size with room to go. Would order again.
