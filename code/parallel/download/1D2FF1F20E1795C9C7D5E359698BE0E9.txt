Five Ten Impact v2 High 2
I purchased these shoes for mountain unicycling (muni) and wasn't disappointed. Too stiff for freestyle but very secure for downhill and trials riding. My BMX friends love them too! Perhaps a bit heavy for some. I usually wear size 11 but the 12's fit me better. Wide enough for older feet.
I bought the Impact Mid to try as a uniform duty boot. They are well padded and so far have been comfortable for the 12 hour shifts I work. The laces tend to sneak over the top of the padded tongue when tied and I have been using a knot with a bow over it. I ordered a 1/2 size up and I think this is about right. They are built rugged as are most 5.10 shoes and should hold up well. The stealth rubber sole is not as sticky as some of their models but should wear well. They have reflective parts and I blacked these out for uniform use. In the fall an Urban Enforcer should be available which is this shoe only in all black with no reflective areas. It is more of a Nubuck style. They should also be a hit with officers.
High Performance High Top - 
I've been looking for a good set of high tops, or any set of high tops for a while... I was very pleased when I discovered the 5 10s...
I purchased these for trials riding, and dirt jump riding. I needed grip and ankle support .I got that and more! I also got great comfort, style and finally a high top. A high top that over achieves in every aspect.
I also like the side entry of these; it helps keep the tongue aligned which I think helps the great comfort level, and protective qualities of the shoe while keeping it relatively light.
My pair virtually fit perfect, I myself am between sizes (10.5 - 11) so I ordered the 11s.
The soles grip very well so well in fact that they will mark tile or linoleum floors if you don't watch how you step. 
I think I'm going to get some more of these...
