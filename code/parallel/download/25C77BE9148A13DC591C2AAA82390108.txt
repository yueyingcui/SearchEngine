Shimano SH-R077
Good entry level cycling shoe. True to size/width and adjustable Velcro straps ensure comfort; no numb feet when riding. Good stiff sole. I like the two or three bolt clip options. There is an open hole underneath the toes for ventilation that extend through the removable insole to keep feet cool in hot weather--but you must avoid stepping in water puddles.
