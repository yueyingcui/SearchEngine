Sanuk Vagabond Chill
Just got my charcoal Vagabond Chills today and they are super comfy and really warm. I did buy one size up though. I'm a size 9 and bought size 10. They fit great and will look good with most business-casual attire, jeans, khaki's, etc.
I'll probably buy another pair without the fur in the spring/summer.
