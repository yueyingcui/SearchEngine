PUMA Sneakerina Wn's
These shoes are very comfortable and are excellent for walking around all day. I have yet to have sore feet at the end of the day. They do run a bit large so order a half size smaller as I had to send the first pair back for a smaller size. They do take a little bit of breaking in as the elastic band is a bit tight at first but they're great after a couple days and they have not given me blisters on the back of my feet at all and I haven't worn them with socks. I would definitely recommend them!
Simply put - great shoes! True to size, cute and comfortable! I plan on using these on a day trip to NYC. I thought I would need a few days to break them in, but not at all - perfectly comfy right out of the box. Great casual shoe!
These sneakers are so comfortable. This is the 2nd pair I've ordered and I wear them all the time. Sized a bit large. I went a half-size down. Nice color that matches everything.
This shoe is so so cute! The picture does not do it justice! I loved these shoes but had to return them..and I was very sad! Based on reviews, I ordered my normal shoe size and the shoe fit perfectly. However, it rubbed on both my outer toes. I do not think a bigger size will help.
This is a stylish sneaker! I bought it in the bright blue/lime green and I am in love. It did feel a little large but I'm not sure the smaller size would have worked so I kept it. I bought my regular size, 10.
They are comfortable shoes. They fit true to size. They have good traction/grip.
