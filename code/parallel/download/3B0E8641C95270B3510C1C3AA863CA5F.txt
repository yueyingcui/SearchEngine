Reebok ZigNano Fly 2 - Aggressive
Not my favorites! These shoes run insanely large, by at least 1/2 size. I had already worn these when I figured that out, so I was stuck. They seemed to grow as well, and all I could do was keep tightening the laces. They are cute, but the white tread makes them look like boats on my feet. There is not as much padding as you would think. I do run, but I would never wear these to run in as they do not have enough support!
