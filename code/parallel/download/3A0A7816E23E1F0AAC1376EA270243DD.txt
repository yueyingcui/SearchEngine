Dexter Bowling V-Strap
Excellent choice - 
For comfort, ease of putting on and taking off and attractive looks, this one is an excellent choice. It runs a bit large though, so try ordering one size larger than your usual shoe instead of 1 1/2 sizes larger.

The shoes were ordered as a Christmas gift, therefore I cannot attest to the comfort. Do feel pricing was very reasonable, delivery was made within a few days of ordering and they appear to me to be correct size and well made. Most certainly would not hesitate in placing orders with you folks in the future.
