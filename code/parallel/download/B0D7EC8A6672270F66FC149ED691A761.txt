This shoe looked exactly like the one I wanted but I was sorely disappointed when I got it. To begin with it's a very heavy shoe; weighs a lot. It was not only too short for my foot but also too narrow. I'd probably have to order a full size larger. I'm rating the shoe 3 star because the style is nice looking.
I am currently trying to decide whether to keep this shoe for long-distance hiking or not. It appears to be very well constructed with good tread. In the size 8WW [formerly I was a 9E in my 977 NB boots], there is plenty of toe box space and the boot seems about right lengthwise [maybe 1/4" long], which is fine for hiking. However, the heel is quite wide, so I'm slipping out at the heel with every step just a bit and that would probably lead to blisters. I tried my superfeet insoles and double socks but am still experiencing some lesser heel slippage. Also, the height of the heel section is shorter than my former mid-height NB977s even with both insoles removed. Unfortunately the new NB 978 did not appear to fit either. If I keep this pair, I will need to search for an insole with a very supportive heel cup.
