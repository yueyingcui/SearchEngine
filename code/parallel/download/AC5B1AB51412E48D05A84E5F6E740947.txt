ASICS GEL-Linksmasterâ„¢
I was looking for a shoe with good heal support to use with custom orthotics.  I wear Asics tennis shoes for support and thought these might provide the same help.  I have worn them on the course twice with good results.  I read the reviews before buying and purchased 1/2 size larger.  Good decision.
I have had Etonic and Nike golf shoes in the past and these by far are the most comfortable I have ever worn. They're comparable to a high quality athletic shoe. Very comfortable from day one. The sporty look gets lots of compliments. Not a big saddle style shoe fan so these definitely fit the bill for my personal taste. Get a half size bigger....
Doesn't feel like a wide, although it was perfect for me because my feet aren't so wide. Once I pulled them out of the box and tried them on, they were so comfortable and snug, I just felt like going for a run in them! These shoes are great! I took them out on the course today and my feet were not sore even one bit. When ordering these, just get half a size bigger than what your feet are exactly. Overall, excellent product!
I have been been wearing Footjoy shoes for 25 years and have a large collection. After just one round wearing these Asics Gel Masters the Footjoys are obsolete. Love them. Not only for comfort and fit but also stance on awkward lies. Phenomenal. Driving, putting the design of the shoe pronates you forward. Two issues, these are not waterproof and you need to order 1/2 a shoe size larger than normal.
