Vans Kids Old Skool V (Infant/Toddler)
Old Skool look for hip little kids!!!
These shoes are great. My son loves them, and they go with just about everything. He is comfortable in them, runs around like a mad man, and even plays on his dad's skateboard in them! I ordered them a half size larger than what he normally wears so they would fit him well. A good friend of the family is in the shoe industry and told me to buy a half size larger when purchasing Vans.

Ok shoe. 
They do not have much arch support and aren't very flexible so my son "trips" over the toe every so often. They do seem to be true to size and have a good look. I was concerned at first that they wouldn't match many of his outfits (I bought the black & green) but they don't stand out that much and go with pretty much anything. Also, the toe and ankle are suede so they work for winter.
Super cool shoe--but too narrow - 
I love Vans but for some reason the toddler shoes run pretty narrow. I tried to order a half size larger but that did not help much. As my 3yrold is breaking them in, he is complaining less about them being too tight but they do seem much narrower than many other kidâ€™s shoes.

These shoes are so funny. I love the reaction from people (old ladies) when they realize my son (18 months) is wearing shoes with skulls on them. They're adorable. I didn't rank them very high on comfort, only because my son's feet are 5 double wide, and Vans doesn't offer wide sizes that I know of.
