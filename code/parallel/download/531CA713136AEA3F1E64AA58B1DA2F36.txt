Garmont Sticky Lizard
The quality of this shoe is unquestionable. It's intelligently constructed and designed  providing the most comfortable and stable approach/hiker shoe I've ever worn. Fit is spot on, the toe box is accommodating (for a size 13) and arch support is perfect. And did I mention stylish? 
I like these a lot. Great approach shoe for bouldering or light hiking.  I wear them in drier conditions as they are water resistant, not waterproof.  Very comfortable out of the box and I did not have any seam issues (as another reviewer noted) or size issues with this shoe.  I measure an 11D and the size 11 fit me great with light/med wool hiking socks. Lacing is well thought out, allowing a snug fit needed for this class of shoe. The materials used are high quality. Trying to find something I don't like about them, but really can't find anything.
