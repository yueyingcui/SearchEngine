etnies Jameson 2 Eco
These shoes are great! They feel true to size. They are very comfortable and look nice. I am wearing them right now; they are a great buy.

The shoes came in 2 days. We were so surprised. Unfortunately, they were too big, but we were able to return them with the shipping paid. We reordered a smaller size, and they also came in 2 days. Great service! The Etnies are great shoes, as always. Very nice-looking.
I buy all my shoes online and wear a size 9. This shoe felt super tight. Make sure you order at least a half size larger when ordering this shoe!
