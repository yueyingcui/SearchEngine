New Balance WW812 Hook-and-Loop
This is quite possibly the most comfortable shoe I've ever owned! I'm on my feet 8+ hours a day so I require a lot from my shoes. I have a very wide foot and these (in 7.5 extra wide) are very true to size. I bought a pair of New Balance lace-ups but I like these better - more comfortable fit around the ankle and more convenient with the velcro straps.
