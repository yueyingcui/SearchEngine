Puma Kids Powercat 4.12 FG Jr (Toddler/Youth)
My 5-year-old son loves these soccer shoes. They run small, so I ordered him 1/2 a size larger than he usually wears. Other than that, they look great and they are very comfortable.
My son loved these shoes but I did have to return one of the 2 pairs that I bought b/c they were so true to size I wanted him to get more than a few months use out of them.
I ordered a half-size bigger based on the reviews and the cleats fit perfectly.  They look exactly as pictured.  My son and I are extremely pleased.
Great cleats. They do run very small so I'd suggest going up a size. I got them for my 6 year old & he really likes them.
