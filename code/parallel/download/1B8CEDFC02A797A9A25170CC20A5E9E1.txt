Vivobarefoot Ultra Pure 
I got the red/gray shoes to walk in the rocky rivers around here and have ended up wearing them everywhere! I can't yet attest to their running comfort but they've been great for kicking around town and playing frisbee. One thing: I normally wear a 10.5 or 11 so I originally got the "44 (US Men's 11)" size. They were WAY too large. Two returns later, the "42 (US Men's 9)" size fit correctly. Either these run a little large or the size translation is off. Actually, I think it's a little of both.
I got these shoes for kayaking, to use as water shoes. They definitely serve the purpose. They're lightweight and pretty comfortable. I have a narrow foot, and these shoes a little wide, so the laces are really pulled tightly together. Also, I wear an 11 Nike running shoe and I got a size 10 in these and they fit well. So buy a size smaller.
I love these. The only complaint I have is that they don't come in half sizes. Even with that I still love 'em.
They are very light and offer good enough cushion on the sole.  The width is little too great for my foot and the shoe does not offer enough synching to get it tight.  I would go a size under what you think you wear as they seem to be a little larger than stated.
