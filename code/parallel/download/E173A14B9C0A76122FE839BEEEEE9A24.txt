New Balance MT20v2
I bought these to replace a pair of the original Minimus and I actually like the new version better. My pair of Minimus 1.0 were very narrow so I ordered these in EE width and found that I had to order a half size smaller when I increased the width. Other than that a great minimal running shoe.
These fit well and are a very comfortable width. My feet are 10¼" and I went with a size 9½ but I could have gone smaller.
This is my first pair of the NB Minimus shoes and overall I like them. I get lots of compliments on the looks and as casual shoes they work well. I don't run in them and I wouldn't try. The cushioning is minimal compared to other athletic shoes. I would say they fit true to size or perhaps a half size big. 
This new MT20v2 is terrible compared to the original mesh version. The original was extremely comfortable when worn with or without socks. This version material is much stiffer and the heel pocket has been changed. I could run miles and miles in the original version with no socks. When I did 10 sprints in these new shoes I developed a blister on my right heel that took a week and a half to heal all the way. I decided to give them another shot and simply went walking in them a few miles and I developed a blister on my left heel! I'm very disappointed NB changed the soft inner material to a more stiff and far less comfortable design. They also seem to run slightly big now. Uggggh! Ive tried buying up all the old version in my size across the internet. I don't know know what I'm going to do once I wear those out, which should be awhile as I got two new pair of the old style.
