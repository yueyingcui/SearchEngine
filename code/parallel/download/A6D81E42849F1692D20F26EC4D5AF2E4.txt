Nike Kids Free Trainer 5.0 (Youth)
The Shoes were purchased for myself, an adult female. I have pruchased youth size shoes before and never had an issue.  They fit fine and are just as nice as in the picture, but the tongue of the shoe is long and where the laces are in the shoe eyelet area bunches up and has potential to bulge "out" a bit as soon as you put them on.  I love the shoes just wasnt happy with that one part of the shoe, over time it seems like that would get worse.  Returning them for something else :-(
