Teva Riva Leather eVentÂ®
I have had this shoe a little over two months and so far I love it. It does run a little smaller than the sticker size by about 1/2 a shoe size. This was perfect for me as nobody makes a 13.5. The shoes is very durable and wears well. After being mad about scratching the leather the first week, it has really blended back in and just looks broken in now. The leather is very tough but also very pliable and forms well to your feet. The stock insoles are very comfy. The lace system works well allowing you to tighten the whole shoe just by pulling on the laces at the top.
Love this shoe...except one thing...the length of shoe!! Tried and tried but too short. When I tried half size up then the width was off. This is a great shoe in every other way. Teva Verdon is the next best.
These shoes are awesomely comfortable right out of the box.  I\'ve had Teva sandals in the past, but this is my first pair of Teva shoes.  I haven\'t had them long, but the comfort and style is great and the construction seems top notch.  One of the other reviews said they felt these shoes ran a bit small, so I ordered these a half size larger than my normal size and I believe it was the right decision.
