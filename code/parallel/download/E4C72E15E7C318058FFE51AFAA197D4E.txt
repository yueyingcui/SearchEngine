SKECHERS Opal
Fits true to size, good support, very comfortable shoe. I wasn't able to tell by the picture that these shoes have a sparkly detail (where you see the "line" under the "s" in the picture. Also, the eyelet detail is very shiny. This makes the shoes look a little juvenile, but I kept them because they're very comfortable.
These shoes are awesome! As a busy mom, I am able to quickly slip on these shoes and run errands or chase after my kids. They are very comfortable! I ordered a half size up than my normal size and they were perfect. They are not for working out in, but I have worn them on the treadmill for a light workout.
I really love Skechers and was excited to try on a new shoe. This shoe is fine, true to size, but the lining inside is so slippery that it has a hard time to stay on. So I have to send these shoes back.
