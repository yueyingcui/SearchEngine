inov-8 Bare-XFâ„¢ 260
I use these to run, going to the gym and just all around basic purpose, fast to put on and take off. Velcro seems to be lasting strong. it is a very comfortable shoe and very lightweight. Feels like your almost wearing nothing! Benefit of this shoe vs the five fingers is that you can wear your everyday sock with them rather then buying special types of socks for your toes to be individual. The one thing I am rating this show negatively about is the looseness around my toes in the shoe. Feels like the area around my toes is 2 sizes larger. hate that and the colors. otherwise no complaints
